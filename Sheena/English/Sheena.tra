@100 = ~I welcome you Sheena. My spies have been searching the lands for over two years, and I was starting to despair of never meeting you.~ 
@101 = ~If you intended to give me a warm welcome Lord Firkraag, explain to me why your goons gagged and dragged me here in chains?~
@102 = ~Forgive my careless servants, I had asked Conster to bring you here as my guest, and certainly not to harm you. Rest assured, he shall be dealt with later.~
@103 = ~My Lord, she wouldn't listen to reason, and we lost four orogs in our attempt to safely bind her.~
@104 = ~Apart from a few bruises, she appears unscathed. You are excused, Conster. As for you Sheena, let me explain the reason for your visit.~ 
@105 = ~Ever since your mother's death when words reaching my ears of *a daughter* attending her funeral, I have been looking for you relentlessly. ~
@106 = ~But...why?~
@107 = ~Long ago, I met your mother. Our relationship lasted only briefly and I never expected a child would result from our fleeting liaison.~ 
@108 = ~I left her, unaware of what was growing inside her.~
@109 = ~Are you suggesting I am your - ~
@110 = ~Daughter? Ah, yes! Humans are prone to concealing the truth, veiling it with countless lies.~ 
@111 = ~Those of your mother about me undoubtedly entailed my premature death at the hand of some evil foe. By now, you should have realised that your father was not human.~
@112 = ~Your words are poison. Let my mother rest in peace, she was a fine woman.~
@113 = ~Your mother was pathetic and weak, as are all humans. Let go of your wretched human existence, it will only bring you pain and death.~
@114 = ~If you so *despise* the human race, then why did you have a liaison with my mother?~
@115 = ~Assuming my human form I was, once, curious and eager to know more about this carnal ritual humans call love.~ 
@116 = ~In the end, your mother proved to be nothing more than an amusing experiment.~
@117 = ~I don't want to hear anymore of this! Let me go!~
@118 = ~*I* will say when it is over! I have devised great plans for you, Sheena.~
@119 = ~And I want no part in them! They are likely filled with evil intent.~
@120 = ~You are headstrong child. For your own good, I will not allow you to neglect such a grand opportunity.~
@121 = ~Conster, I want the child to... reflect on her predicament. Lock her up in one of the empty cells. A few days of confinement will break her impetuous will.~
@122 = ~Yes, my Lord.~
@123 = ~You are a monster! I will not be caged so easily.~
@124 = ~It is useless to resist, my powers far exceed yours.~

@1000 = ~(The creature is unable to talk. She seems spellbound and unaware of your presence.)~
@1001 = ~Good gracious! Finally someone with enough powers to end this madness! Could you please release me from captivity, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@1002 = ~Hell no! I could have sworn I just saw a half dragon right where you stand. You won't go *anywhere* until you explain this trickery.~
@1003 = ~There's nobody holding you but yourself. Just who are you?~
@1004 = ~How did a young lass manage to get herself locked up in here?~
@1005 = ~As you can plainly see, I am the only one locked up here. I would be grateful if you would step aside and let me leave.~
@1006 = ~Who are you?~
@1007 = ~If it looks like a rat and smells like a rat, it is a rat. I won't let you go without answers.~
@1008 = ~Not until you tell me all about your predicament and the reason for your incarceration.~
@1009 = ~I am a simple woman trapped in a cell. Can I leave now?~
@1010 = ~How did you get locked up in here?~
@1011 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>, and being at times somewhat suspicious of the people I set free, I would first require of you to tell me your story.~
@1012 = ~Your anguish in wanting to run away from this place is understandable, but the fact that you do not seek protection on your way out leaves me somewhat suspicious.~
@1013 = ~It's a long story that I find hard to explain to myself. I doubt - adventurer - you have time enough to hear it in its entirety.~
@1014 = ~If you want safe passage out of this place, I will need some answers.~
@1015 = ~Well, you'd better keep your story short; the place is swarming with evil beasts, and they could be back any time soon.~
@1016 = ~The place was freed from danger, and I always take my time to hear a good story.~
@1017 = ~I had been living peacefully in the mountains, near the spine of the world, when a month ago a man - Conster - and several orogs raided my house.~
@1018 = ~They told me a certain Lord Jierdan wished to speak to me - an urgent matter which needed to be attended to as soon as possible.~
@1019 = ~I pressed them for more reasons as to why I should leave my home to meet a complete stranger, and even questioned them about why this Lord Jierdan had not partaken in the trip.~
@1020 = ~They soon ran out of suitable answers, and Conster's mood changed when he finally realized he could not bend me to his will. I found suddenly myself surrounded by menacing faces.~
@1021 = ~A fight ensued. I tried as hard as I could to make my way to the door and beyond to the safety of the woods, but in the end Conster managed to freeze me in my steps with a simple spell.~
@1022 = ~Bound and gagged, carried on the back of a disgusting orog, we slowly marched to Amm. From Conster's conversations during the evening meals, I learned of Jierdan's other name, Firkraag, and that of course he was a red dragon interested in my vested powers.~
@1023 = ~Still, that does not tell me what business Firkraag had with you.~
@1024 = ~If what you say is true then it is an adequate story, but what did the monster want from you?~
@1025 = ~Your story would sound hollow if I failed to hear the end of it. Go on.~
@1026 = ~He confessed to a liaison with my mother long ago, and suggested I could be his daughter.~
@1027 = ~I knew my eyes weren't cheating me. So what are you really?~
@1028 = ~Such a thing is unheard of! Are you truly the daughter of the beast?~
@1029 = ~If it looks like a rat and smells like a rat, it is a rat. I won't let you go without answers. Time to die, foul beast!~
@1030 = ~My human mother died several years ago, but she had not been very forthcoming - or truthful - about her first relationship, for I had developed some extraordinary abilities.~
@1031 = ~I am able to shapeshift into a half dragon at will.~
@1032 = ~When Lord Jierdan told me he had briefly entered into a relationship with my mother, I almost lost consciousness. I found it so hard to believe, but it explained the presence of my unnatural powers.~
@1033 = ~Then you'll be grieved to know that we just slew your father.~
@1034 = ~The beast died in bitter pain only minutes ago.~
@1035 = ~If you go downstairs to pay your final homage to your late father, I suggest you mind the floor. It's slick with blood.~
@1036 = ~I should present you my condolences then. You will find his corpse downstairs, and I suggest getting the coffin commissioned.~
@1037 = ~I have your father's skin in my backpack. A nice trophy, which I fully intend to wear in combat if I can find a smith skilled enough.~
@1038 = ~I won't mourn for his loss if that's what you're trying to imply. The beast meant nothing to me. He abducted me, sullied my mother's memory and finally locked me in here to rot. Tell me what kind of tender, loving father would do such a thing? ~
@1039 = ~I already have a father and never needed nor wanted his replacement, especially by someone as evil as Firkraag.~
@1040 = ~I sense sincerity in your words. So, what's your name, dragonspawn?~
@1041 = ~Your words ring true. You have no affinity for the beast. I'd like to know who addresses me, dragonspawn?~
@1042 = ~But I have done nothing wrong, <PRO_RACE>. Please, let me go, and it will be the last time you'll hear from me. I *swear* to you.~
@1043 = ~Sorry, but I cannot take the chance that you were not in league with the foul beast. I cannot allow you to terrorize honest citizens any longer.~
@1044 = ~Your plea is touching, but if you fail to give me one good reason for keeping you alive, you will be signing your own death warrant.~
@1045 = ~Lets call it revenge on the daughter... it is now your turn to die, dragonspawn.~
@1046 = ~I understand. Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@1047 = ~Back to my home and to the man I consider as my true father.~
@1048 = ~Well, have a safe journey then.~
@1049 = ~I'm always in need of able companions skilled in the art combat, magic or both. Can I tempt you to travel in my company?~
@1050 = ~My name is Sheena, but please don't ever call me dragonspawn *again*. I don't need to be reminded at every turn of what I despise the most about myself. Anyway, may I leave now?~
@1051 = ~You are free to go, Sheena and I wish you the best of luck.~
@1052 = ~I'm always in need of able companions skilled in the art of combat, magic or both. Can I tempt you to travel in my company?~
@1053 = ~Where will you go, Sheena?~
@1054 = ~An odd request, but then...I certainly owe you my freedom. However, before you go any further I feel I must confess that I am not in total control of my shapeshifting abilities, and occasionally assume my draconic form unconsciously with dire consequences for humans, elves, gnomes, orcs and dwarves alike. Most panic and flee at the first sight of it. ~
@1055 = ~For this reason, I tend to shy away from cities. Deliberate carefully on this, for I may well prove a hindrance to your adventures rather than an aid.~
@1056 = ~Your words of caution are perfectly understood, but I still wish you to consider my proposal.~
@1057 = ~Err, actually, I changed my mind - I think it would be far better if you returned to your home.~
@1058 = ~Tell me more about this draconic form of yours. Can you breathe fire, fly or tear a man's flesh apart in one swing of your claws?~
@1059 = ~Keeping the city's rabble out of my way would be a refreshing change.~
@1060 = ~I thank you for your cautious advice. It would be wise - indeed - if you returned to your home.~
@1061 = ~Petty details! My mission requires that I muster all the strength I can find.~
@1062 = ~No, I cannot do the things of which you speak. I simply become a stronger person, and assume such a bloodcurdling appearance that those witnessing it are usually stricken with fear.~
@1063 = ~Well, then it would be best if you returned to your home.~
@1064 = ~Keeping the city's rabble out my way would be a nice change.~
@1065 = ~I thank you for your cautious words. It would be wise if you returned to your home, I think.~
@1066 = ~I well understand why you advise caution, but I would still like you to consider my proposal.~
@1067 = ~If you think you can use me as a freak, scaring beggars and peasants off the streets, you are wrong. ~
@1068 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>.~
@1069 = ~Is your mission so deadly that you would set aside the risk of alienating an entire city? I wish to know more before I pledge my sword. I would hope it is not anything reprehensible.~
@1070 = ~Rest assured, you'd be serving a noble cause. A close friend whom I have known since childhood was recently abducted by the Cowled Wizards in Ahtkatla for no reason, and I intend to rescue her.~
@1071 = ~I am chasing a powerful wizard by the name of Jon Irenicus.~
@1072 = ~Most noble indeed. Since I owe you my freedom, I will gladly repay my debt by helping you in this endeavor.~
@1073 = ~What's your score with this Jon Irenicus?~
@1074 = ~I have countless reasons for hating him. He abducted and tortured me and some of my companions, killing others, and it is because of him that my childhood friend was abducted by the Cowled Wizards of Athkatla.~
@1075 = ~I owe him a great debt of pain which will only be repaid with his death.~
@1076 = ~He doesn't seem to be the pleasant fellow and I will gladly join you in the hunt for him and the recovery of your friend.~
@1077 = ~You seem to have suffered a great deal by his hand. What could he have done to provoke your wrath?~
@1078 = ~ I have countless reasons for hating him. He abducted and tortured me and some of my companions, killing others, and it is because of him that my childhood friend was abducted by the Cowled Wizards of Athkatla.~
@1079 = ~I ask you to trust me, Sheena- he is both powerful and evil. Your father knew him and said he was expecting an interesting confrontation. Maybe he told you something that could help me locate the wizard?~
@1080 = ~(Sheena's eyes blaze.) Do not refer to Lord Firkraag as my father, <CHARNAME>, for he is *not*.~
@1081 = ~But no, our conversation was very brief and centred around my own person. No mention of a powerful wizard, nor of you.~
@1082 = ~You have me intrigued, perhaps I will aid you in finding answers. Are you serious in your offer?~
@1083 = ~Of course! Join with me, Sheena, and let the hunt begin.~
@1084 = ~Sorry, I've changed my mind. It would be better if you returned to your home.~
@1085 = ~I sincerely hope you will find this wizard, whatever his name is. Well met, friend, and farewell.~

@1500 = ~I cannot leave your side <CHARNAME>. The ritual has been performed and we are one.~
@1501 = ~Sorry, a simple mistake Sheena.~
@1502 = ~Is my task at your side complete?~
@1503 = ~No, I am still in need of you, Sheena.~
@1504 = ~Please wait till I return Sheena, I won't be long.~
@1505 = ~Traveling at your side has proved far more dangerous than I thought. Yes, I must ask you to leave.~
@1506 = ~Waiting here could look suspicious and raise a few eyebrows.~
@1507 = ~I will travel back to the spine of the world. I fare you well.~
@1508 = ~If your travel leads you to the spine of the world one day, do come and see me. Farewell, <CHARNAME>. ~

@2000 = ~Rare are the people who look kindly on half breeds, especially half dragons. You show neither fear nor prejudice. Such a trait is remarkable.~ [K#Sheena]
@2001 = ~Half breeds, especially those of orcish origin, are particularly despised. I have countless remembrances of futile mockery to share with you. I envy you your disguising skills.~
@2002 = ~My ears have caught a fair share of mockery amongst humans, but surely that is a mere pang compared to what people must have tossed at you.~
@2003 = ~My origin is - after all - as contemptible as yours and the reason I spared you.~
@2004 = ~I do not look favorably on half breeds and only had an interest in your vested powers.~
@2005 = ~Your life must have been quite harsh, Sheena.~
@2006 = ~I should have surmised the obvious. Your greenish pigmentation leaves no doubt as to your lineage. Yes, I have been more fortunate as my concealment skills appeared quite early in my childhood.~
@2007 = ~But by then, most children were aware of my disparity and frequently tossed insults at me. I was never able to fully blend with the other children in the village wherein I grew up.~
@2008 = ~We share some striking similarities. If it wasn't for that dragon *thing*, I'd say we've lived a similar past.~
@2009 = ~Imoen proved to be a great support. She was different from everyone else.~
@2010 = ~Perhaps it is the reason you enlisted me at your side.~
@2011 = ~It would have been a dull one. I hate prejudice of any kind, and I choose my companions based on their character and skills, and their ability to aid me in achieving my goals.~
@2012 = ~You are akin to me in some ways, and it could help us both.~
@2013 = ~You shed new light on your motives with each word you speak, <CHARNAME>. One can take great pride in joining you on such a noble quest to rescue an old friend.~
@2014 = ~I am glad you feel so.~
@2015 = ~My half dragon heart couldn't agree less. I sense your heart has been forged with the steel of other's mockery while it resisted turning to stone.~
@2016 = ~Quite right. Although I would love to continue this conversation, the hour is late.~
@2017 = ~My heart has been forged by a greater burden which I have no desire to speak to you about yet.~
@2018 = ~You would be a shrewd fortune teller. Children can be most cruel at times and I still praise the day when my disguising skills first appeared. Though, I was never able to fully blend with the other children in the village wherein I grew up.~
@2019 = ~I surmise we shared a similar past. I had trouble blending with others in both elven and human settlements. They tended to see and scorn my other half.~
@2020 = ~A poignant story, I'm sure - but I have no wish to hear it.~
@2021 = ~I am somewhat puzzled. Your human form betrays none of your draconic origins. How do you accomplish such an amazing feat?~
@2022 = ~It would be a dull one. I hate prejudice of any kind- I choose my companions based upon their character and skills.~
@2023 = ~Yes... sure, we have better things to do than discussing the past. Let's move on and carve our future in steel!~
@2024 = ~It is far more potent than a conventional polymorph spell. This spell turns me into a human in every aspect, including weaknesses. In all truth, I greatly enjoy it. It is far more comfortable when I rest on my back as most inns do not provide sizeable beds for half dragons.~
@2025 = ~Won't you tell me more of your origins, since it seems so similar to mine?~
@2026 = ~We have barely met. I do not wish to share my origins with you yet.~
@2027 = ~Tell me of your own past instead, I surmise your childhood must have been quite harsh.~
@2028 = ~Ah! I should have guessed your intentions on our first encounter. My interest in remaining at your side falters <CHARNAME>.~
@2029 = ~My interest in you stems directly from my own rather contemptible origin, Sheena.~
@2030 = ~You could prove my fiercest weapon with which I will crush my enemies.~
@2031 = ~Are you comparing me to a mace, a hammer or a flail maybe?~
@2032 = ~Excuse my careless words, I did not mean to be rude.~
@2033 = ~Aye. You are a large hammer, a weapon with which to destroy my foes.~
@2034 = ~Aye. You are large mace, a weapon with which to destroy my foes.~
@2035 = ~Aye. You are a large flail, a weapon with which to destroy my foes.~
@2036 = ~Your apology is accepted, but then what did you mean?~
@2037 = ~You are both rude and dull, <CHARNAME>, and I take no joy in adventuring with you. Farewell, and I hope we never meet again!~
@2038 = ~Children can be cruel at times, and I still praise the day when my skills at concealment first appeared. Though, I was never able to fully blend with the other children in the village wherein I grew up.~
@2039 = ~A poignant tale,I'm sure - but I have no wish to hear it.~
@2040 = ~I am sometimes puzzled. Your human form betrays none of your draconic origins, how do you accomplish such an amazing feat?~
@2041 = ~Have you ever heard of a blade called Carsomyr, or the Holy Avenger?~ [K#Sheena]
@2042 = ~Yes, we found it on your father's - well, Firkraag's - remains. Why do you ask?~
@2043 = ~Sure, I've tossed it somewhere in my backpack. Would you like to have a look at it?~
@2044 = ~I recall possessing it, but I believe we sold it.~
@2045 = ~One of the finest blades I've had the privilege to wield. Why do you ask?~
@2046 = ~My stepfather's great grandfather crafted it. My family have  been smithies for generations. My stepfather is one of the most renowned weapon smith in all Faerun. ~
@2047 = ~People sometimes travel as far as Waterdeep and all the way to the spine of the world to commission weapons and armors from him.~
@2048 = ~I would like to meet your stepfather sometime, Sheena. What's his name?~
@2049 = ~Did your stepfather also teach you his skills?~
@2050 = ~You are pulling my leg. Firkraag, and now a rich and famous smithy!~
@2051 = ~I'm curious. Who commissioned Carsomyr?~
@2052 = ~Your lineage could confuse even the most astute historian, let alone me.~
@2053 = ~Samuel Thunderstorm. Heard of him?~
@2054 = ~Awfully familiar, I can't put a face on his name though. Tell me, did your stepfather also teach you his skills?~
@2055 = ~I've never heard of him before.~
@2056 = ~As a child, I could stay around the forge for hours. All this glittering dust dancing around his face, whilst he was hammering the steel... it was a fascinating sight. ~
@2057 = ~Alas, he never allowed me to witness the enchantment process. A rare favor bestowed only on the true initiates of the art or a fourth level apprentice.~
@2058 = ~Have a closer look at my blade. It says on the hilt: "To My Beloved Stepdaughter Sheena: may this blade shield you during evil times." It was enchanted using the heart of a firegiant and the tentacle of an Illithid- or so he proclaimed.~
@2059 = ~Both precious items had been kept in a small ivory box for over 15 years, awaiting one special occasion, which turned out to be my fifteenth birthday and the forging of Sheena's Avenger.~
@2060 = ~I must admit that yours is one of the finest two handed swords I ever laid my eyes upon.~
@2061 = ~I always wondered how smithies could bring magic in weapons. Can you shed some light on your stepfather's craft?~
@2062 = ~I am impressed by both your blade and your stepfather's skill.~
@2063 = ~The engraving proves little. My best bet is: you're making up this story to impress me.~
@2064 = ~Illithids?~
@2065 = ~Maybe my real father was Firkraag, but the father in my heart will always be Samuel.~
@2066 = ~Most family members utterly disagree with one another on its cradle. Some proclaim a god visited the great grandfather, some speak of a powerful paladin, the only opinion on which they all concur is that he passed away right after crafting the blade.~
@2067 = ~It sounds so strange. The blade carved by your stepfather great grandfather landing in the care of your real father.~
@2068 = ~Oh, well. My history will one day strike you as true, I hope.~
@2069 = ~Illithids are brain devourer, creatures which dwell in the underdark. I pray we never meet Ilsensine the tentacled god of that abominable race. I used to be really scared as a child when my stepfather told me all those gruesome tales about him.~
@2070 = ~Yes, I hope we won't. But, I always wondered how smithies could bring magic into weapons. Can you shed some light on your stepfather's craft?~
@2071 = ~It sounds so strange. The blade carved by your stepfather's great grandfather landing in the care of your real father... it seems to me as though they're connected.~
@2072 = ~It is undoubtely nothing but a harmless coincidence.~
@2073 = ~I do not wish to intrude on your personal history, <CHARNAME>, but your 'contemptible origins' have drawn my curiosity and I'd like to ask you again-~ [K#Sheena]
@2074 = ~I have a unique heritage. I am a Bhaalspawn - a child of the dead god Bhaal.~
@2075 = ~I have still no wish to blab about it, Sheena.~
@2076 = ~My father was no peasant, but Bhaal himself, Lord of Murder.~
@2077 = ~It feels so weird. The son of the god of murder travelling with the daughter of a ruthless dragon. Do you surmise a mere coincidence or a mysterious hand playing our mutual fate?~
@2078 = ~A coincidence of this magnitude leaves me with few doubts.~
@2079 = ~A twist of fate placed you on my path Sheena, nothing more.~
@2080 = ~My mind is still undecided. Perhaps the answer will reveal itself when the time is right.~
@2081 = ~Suit yourself. I won't raise the matter again.~
@2082 = ~A scary thought that we might be both pawns drawn into some unknown design.~
@2083 = ~I feel relieved to hear you share my feelings on this matter. I should hate to think that I am but a pawn in some grand design.~
@2084 = ~One can only hope or pray for the best.~
@2085 = ~Your divine heritage seems to have little effect on both your personality and your appearance. I truly do envy you, <CHARNAME>. My Draconic appearance is so ugly that I've never dared to own a mirror.~ [K#Sheena]
@2086 = ~What you say barely makes sense. How can you conclude you are ugly if you've never seen your own reflection?~
@2087 = ~True beauty lies in the soul and mind of a person, not in one's physical appearance.~
@2088 = ~A wise decision. Any mirror will shatter the day when it sees your reflection.~
@2089 = ~I find your draconic form fascinating...I find myself drawn to it like a moth to a flame.~
@2090 = ~I've learned about my true appearance from the human stare. Each time they see this form, I see fear, abhorrence and disdain in their eyes.~
@2091 = ~And what do you see in my eyes whenever you assume your draconic form Sheena?~
@2092 = ~True beauty lies in the soul and mind of a person, not in one's physical appearance.~
@2093 = ~I have to admit that any mirror will shatter the day when it sees your reflection.~
@2094 = ~I find your draconic form fascinating. I find myself drawn to it like a moth to a flame.~
@2095 = ~I really wish that your wise words could comfort me, but it seems I will never be at peace with my half dragon form.~
@2096 = ~Within you, I see a fragile being, filled with goodness, longing to be someone else. You will have to let go of this - this longing, Sheena. This path only leads to pain, and sorrow.~
@2097 = ~Let me ask you, what do you see in my eyes whenever you assume your draconic appearance, Sheena?~
@2098 = ~I'm afraid you are right. Any mirror will shatter the day when it sees your reflection.~
@2099 = ~I was seeking your comfort and never expected your scorn in its stead. Don't look for more confidences, <CHARNAME>, you're such a sad person!~
@2100 = ~You do! I-I never would have expected to hear that from anyone, let alone a <PRO_RACE>. What can you possibly find attractive in such a hideous monster?~
@2101 = ~Forget about what I said. By now, you should know better. True beauty does not lie in one's physical appearance.~
@2102 = ~A lizard's tail and demon's wings! I have to agree. It's repelling. I was simply teasing you, Sheena.~
@2103 = ~Dragons are a majestic sight, and you are no exception, Sheena.~
@2104 = ~I-I see nothing. As if you defied all prejudice toward my kind. I am blessed to have met you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2105 = ~Remember Sheena, true beauty does not lie in one's own physical appearance.~
@2106 = ~I find your draconic form fascinating and find myself drawn to it like a moth to a flame.~
@2107 = ~Thank you <CHARNAME>, I will do as you say and try to think more positively by using what I find worthy in me.~
@2108 = ~Perhaps... perhaps all these painful memories should finally be laid at rest. I may have been too harsh with my true self and it is time I assume who I really am, a half dragon!~

@2109 = ~Did I tell you how I acquired my fighting skills?~ [K#Sheena]
@2110 = ~Let me guess...your stepfather?~
@2111 = ~Your skills are barely noticeable, so I wouldn't boast too much about them.~
@2112 = ~Each day, when the sun had not yet cleared the morning mist, we would take our wooden swords and train for hours. My stepfather was unforgiving, punishing my weaknesses with harsh blows and never allowing me a moment's respite.~
@2113 = ~With each year that passed, my strength and my skills grew, until finally the day came when I could match him. It was at that time when I decided to focus my training on magic.~
@2114 = ~An old witch lived nearby. People seldom visited her, fearing her power and awful moods. My desire to learn magic prevailed over my apprehension, and I decided to visit her.~
@2115 = ~She certainly was reluctant at first and tried to scare me away. But, my patience and good nature got the better of her, and she agreed to let me study her spellbooks.~
@2116 = ~I miss the old witch as much as my stepfather. It may sound silly, <CHARNAME>, but I suddenly feel homesick.~
@2117 = ~Your skills - I must admit - far exceed mine.~
@2118 = ~Magic users are so hopeless in discussing the noble art of swordplay.~
@2119 = ~Druids strive to maintain a certain balance, and violence certainly does not fit in with the grand design.~
@2120 = ~Ah yes! A quick stab in the back is probably the only decent sword skill that a thief finds truly noteworthy of <PRO_HISHER> attention.~
@2121 = ~Healers don't approve of swordplay, really. It burdens their work with additional wounds to heal.~
@2122 = ~I should probably tell you that you are not my first-~ [K#Sheena]
@2123 = ~I wish you'd finish your sentence, Sheena. I can surmise a lot from what was left unsaid... (Grin)~
@2124 = ~Stop teasing, Sheena, and get on with it!~
@2125 = ~Perhaps another of your strange revelations, Sheena, something like you had a lover once?~
@2126 = ~Well, this is not my first adventure so would you care to hear about my past exploits?~
@2127 = ~Let me guess, you single handedly defeated a rat in your cellar, using your mum's broomstick at the age of six?~
@2128 = ~I will listen to your tale if you can keep it short and interesting.~
@2129 = ~Why do people always need to boast about their past achievements? Frankly, I have no wish to listen to them.~
@2130 = ~(Laugh). I was about to tell you that I had adventures before, but sadly none of the romantic kind. So would you care to hear about my own adventures?~
@2131 = ~Then let me try another guess, you single handedly defeated a rat in your cellar with your mum's broomstick at the age of six?~
@2132 = ~I wish you would take me a trifle more seriously.~
@2133 = ~But you are too serious. Um. I apologize. Please, go on with your tale.~
@2134 = ~Sorry, I simply can't stand listening to anything serious today.~
@2135 = ~Occasionally, small bands of orcs or barbarians from the northern tribes roam our land in search of food and easy plunder, preying mostly on on our farmers.~
@2136 = ~My stepfather has proven invaluable to the community, equipping them with the finest weapons and training them to match the skills of hardened soldiers.~
@2137 = ~But then came the year of the turret, and we caught the unexpected, leaving us baffled and unprepared.~
@2138 = ~An ancient demon had gathered a small army of orcs and threatened to destroy us all, save if we left our land.~
@2139 = ~I immediately volunteered to challenge the demon- to my stepfather's obvious displeasure.~
@2140 = ~I argued with him for several hours and fortunately found several allies amongst the peasants, who were obviously too distraught at the idea of facing a demon. It was plain to see that the men had already been routed by fear and my stepfather had no other choice but to reluctantly agree.~
@2141 = ~The battle would take place on the forgotten fields of mount Clain the following morning. I spent most of the evening discussing tactics with my stepfather, and the right protection required to defeat such an evil foe.~
@2142 = ~It proved an invaluable remedy to the fear that was starting to rise from my guts. I was anxious to confront the beast and hardly slept that night.~
@2143 = ~The demon was as fearsome as expected, and when he heard the challenge from such a young girl, he yelled several spiteful remarks at my stepfather. But he couldn't resist the offer and agreed.~
@2144 = ~The first part of our plan was a success. As we expected, the demon engaged the battle overconfident, and with little preparation, unaware I was a half dragon in disguise.~
@2145 = ~I engaged the demon, well prepared with a minor globe of invulnerability, stoneskin, protection from fire, fear and mirror image.~
@2146 = ~The demon first boasted that the minor cuts I was inflicting on him would be pale compared with the brutal force he would soon unleash upon me.~
@2147 = ~Unabashed, I kept hitting him, cutting through his flesh again and again and again. Strangely, the demon kept his audience of orcs laughing, telling them: "See! I wouldn't even hurt a fly".~
@2148 = ~His little teasing game had been lasting for a while, and by then, the demon was already badly wounded. On a fortunate critical hit, I saw his red eyes filling with rage and heard him faintly whispering the words: "You bore me little girl. I'm afraid your time has come to embrace the next world".~
@2149 = ~The time was ripe to show him who I really was and I swiftly regained my half dragon form.~
@2150 = ~His raging eyes quickly turned to sheer surprise, then fear. He knew his excessive confidence had sealed his fate.~
@2151 = ~His pathetic attempts to paralyze me all failed due to the minor globe and he had no luck either with his claws.~
@2152 = ~Soon, he died and his army of orcs quickly dispersed, running madly whereto they came from.~
@2153 = ~An interesting tale of bravery mixed with the indubitable foolishness of a demon.~
@2154 = ~A rousing tale - but is there any moral in it?~
@2155 = ~One should never underestimate his opponent no matter how weak he appears to be, and always be fully prepared to meet the worst. Let us never forget that overconfidence leads to our doom.~
@2156 = ~I had single handedly defeated a demon but my bravery came at a price.~ [K#Sheena]
@2157 = ~What is that drivel all about?~
@2158 = ~All actions have consequences. I wonder what befell on you after you vanquished that demon.~
@2159 = ~Your first tale was amiable enough, and I listened to it as any gentleman would. So please spare me any further inconvenience.~
@2160 = ~Your first tale was amiable enough and I listened to it as any Lady would. So please spare me any further inconvenience.~
@2161 = ~All actions have consequences, and a good name can sometimes turn into a curse as you will find out in this tale.~
@2162 = ~My reputation spread like a wildfire, soon reaching the larger cities of the ten towns. At first, folks travelling through our area would drop in to say a few words of praise.~
@2163 = ~But my reputation also soon reached the ears of malevolent persons and notably the Cult of the Dragon.~
@2164 = ~The famed Cult of the Dragon - no less, and they took an interest in you? Tell me what happened?~
@2165 = ~Cult of the Dragon? I've never heard of them. Who are they exactly?~
@2166 = ~Very well. You won't hear a word from me- ever again.~
@2167 = ~They are evil necromancers who worship dragons in the hope to bring their rule over Faerun to fruition. One of their leaders visited my stepfather and enticed him with false promises of greater accomplishments should his stepdaughter join the cult. He said they could teach me far more in the art of magic.~
@2168 = ~And did your stepfather agree to it?~
@2169 = ~How could your stepfather fail to notice such an evil plan?~
@2170 = ~The cult relishes remaining secret and cloaks its activities in darkness so very few really know about them. Although my stepfather was somewhat reluctant to see me leave, I was thrilled by the prospect of learning new skills, especially in the art of magic.~
@2171 = ~My stepfather once again gave way to my arguments and I was on my way to meet the other members of the Cult of the Dragon.~
@2172 = ~But this tale is quite long and I should save it for next time.~
@2173 = ~On our way to the Cult's hideout, they said I would soon meet Vinamar, one akin to me.~ [K#Sheena]
@2174 = ~You mean another half dragon.~
@2175 = ~Do dragons breed so frequently outside their own race? I find it hard to believe. They'd near extinction if they all did.~
@2176 = ~Yes. Another half red.~
@2177 = ~Some do or so I was told.~
@2178 = ~But they had well disguised their lies and deceits, and I was heading for a trap.~
@2179 = ~Vinamar greeted me at the end of the journey and I sensed great evil in him. ~
@2180 = ~My mind wanted to flee the place but my body was petrified. The truth was shocking; Vinamar was a half red dragon but he was undead.~
@2181 = ~His devious plan entailed using the Cult of the Dragon to perform the dark ritual which would turn me into an immortal lich. He and I would breed a powerful new race of half dracoliches that would rule Faerun, he said.~
@2182 = ~My heart sank deeper into despair when countless Cult members started surrounding me.~
@2183 = ~I dare not to imagine anything but a bold escape.~
@2184 = ~Dracoliches? I've never heard of such creatures before.~
@2185 = ~There are times when one becomes much wiser by leaving the battlefield.~
@2186 = ~I simply cast an invisibility spell and ran as fast as I could toward the sanctity of the woods.~
@2187 = ~Some dark nights, trapped in some dreadful nightmare, I can still hear Vinamar, shouting that he will find me, wherever I go.~
@2188 = ~Throughout history there have been those that have sought immortality at any cost. Many have searched in vain for the fabled waters of life or begged blessings from the gods, but a few, who have studied the magical arts, have access to an alternate, more sinister mean of achieving their goal. ~
@2189 = ~Through spell, incantation and extraordinary magical ascendancy, there are those who have attempted to twist themselves into the form of an immortal lich. Though most wizards attempt the ritual themselves, willing dragons or half dragons rely on the Cult of the Dragon necromancer to achieve this supreme form.~
@2190 = ~I certainly did not want to take any part in his plan.~
@2191 = ~In my heart, I knew he would. I wouldn't be safe for very long and made haste for my stepfather's home.~
@2192 = ~My stepfather was unabashed by the ill-news and brilliantly proposed we fake my death.~
@2193 = ~I was to lay flat on the slope of the mountain, covered with red ink, as if I had fallen from the cornice above and died.~
@2194 = ~A cheap trick only a few could fall for. But I guess your other options were running out, either hiding the rest of your life or to give yourself up to Vinamar.~
@2195 = ~Could Vinamar really be fooled by your stepfather's ploy?~
@2196 = ~Vinamar was travelling with some Cult members and found us hours later. My stepfather, lying beside me, partly covering my body as if he were tending a mortal injury, started blaming them for my death.~
@2197 = ~His distraught and tears during their argument sounded and looked so real that Vinamar, in the end, simply retreated. My stepfather's brilliant plan had worked for both our sake and relief.~
@2198 = ~Your stepfather is an extraordinary man and resourceful, which is not unworthy of a compliment. I wish I could meet him one day.~
@2199 = ~Young girls should never follow strangers...~
@2200 = ~My stepfather rarely seeks recognition for himself but your compliment would surely flatter him.~
@2201 = ~I miss him...I miss him a lot.~
@2202 = ~Great evils lie in our midst, and so I am glad to share your company, <CHARNAME>. Lately, I have been sleeping much better at night, confident in the knowledge that my companions will come to my aid, were I beset with peril.~
@2203 = ~My tales must sound hollow compared to your achievements, or so I heard. Won't you tell me more about your adventure at Baldur's gate?~ [K#Sheena]
@2204 = ~I have no desire to recount my past adventures. They are but pain and sorrow.~
@2205 = ~My stepfather Gorion was slain and I killed my half brother Sarevok. But such tales are better left unstirred.~
@2206 = ~I also heard you averted a war between Amn and Baldur. A commendable deed that surely deserves to be recounted.~
@2207 = ~I have still no wish to share my past with you.~
@2208 = ~If you know that much then I have nothing more to add.~
@2209 = ~My half brother Sarevok sought to stir a war between Amn and Baldur's Gate through a brilliantly planned iron shortage. I simply unveiled his plans before the council, ending both his dream of power and his life.~
@2210 = ~I also heard you averted a war between Amn and Baldur's Gate. A commendable deed that also explains the reason for your half brother's death.~
@2211 = ~I bear no ill-feeling toward you, but I simply don't like where this conversation is leading us.~
@2212 = ~If you know the story then, why do you bother me by asking?~
@2213 = ~A tale reveals a <PRO_MANWOMEN>'s past deeds, unfolding some truth about whom <PRO_HESHE> is. I have disclosed so much, but you tend to fend off my attempts to reveal more about yourself.~
@2214 = ~So much truth is warped through hearsay- and then, of course, most tales are but inflated lies.~
@2215 = ~My half brother Sarevok sought to stir a war between Amn and Baldur's Gate through a brilliantly planned iron shortage. I simply unveiled his plans before the council, ending both his dream of power and his life.~
@2216 = ~You surely realize your noble action saved thousands of innocent lives, people who would have else perished in a futile and unjust war. You should not so lightly brush off your past accomplishments.~
@2217 = ~I do not. I simply believe that boasting of my exploits in every tavern would attract scores of new enemies. I cannot allow it.~
@2218 = ~I wasn't born a hero. I averted this war because I had to; my life depended on it, put simply.~
@2219 = ~I am faithful to your cause <CHARNAME>. So, every secret you decide to share with me will remain sealed within my mind and will not be breathed to a soul.~
@2220 = ~Heroes are often born from the need of saving their own skin. There is nothing to be ashamed of.~
@2221 = ~Do you imply I willfully lied to you?~
@2222 = ~Perhaps not intentionally, but yes.~
@2223 = ~No. I simply believe tales are inflated through hearsay or their narrators exaggerate the truth to capture the attention of their audience.~
@2224 = ~I promise you. I won't annoy you with my tales ever again.~
@2225 = ~I hear you well, <CHARNAME>. But I assure you, I did not try to deceive you in relating my own past.~
@2226 = ~I like your tales Sheena, so it matters little how much truth they hold.~
@2227 = ~The demon story was farfetched and this half red dragon who wanted to take you as his bride sounded really like wishful thinking.~
@2228 = ~Do you worship a god, <CHARNAME>?~ [K#Sheena]
@2229 = ~With Bhaal's blood flowing through my veins, I do not see the purpose of worshipping a god.~
@2230 = ~I worship Mystra, who blesses me with magic.~
@2231 = ~I worship Gond, the wonderbringer.~
@2232 = ~I worship Clangeddin Silverbeard.~
@2233 = ~I worship Torm.~
@2234 = ~I worship Helm, the vigilant one.~
@2235 = ~I worship Mask, god of thieves.~
@2236 = ~I worship Talos, the storm god.~
@2237 = ~I worship Selune, goddess of light.~
@2238 = ~It is quite understandable- but then again, you are still a mortal, <CHARNAME>.~
@2239 = ~And do you worship a god, Sheena?~
@2240 = ~I thought Mystra died on the Celestial Stairway upon challenging Helm.~
@2241 = ~Yes, but her powers passed onto her servant midnight who took her name and mantle. Mystra has gone through many incarnations, and the current is but one of them. Do you worship a god, Sheena?~
@2242 = ~I should have known better given you are a gnome.~
@2243 = ~I should have known better given you are a dwarf.~
@2244 = ~I thought Torm died at the hand of the black lord Bane in the city of Tantras...?~
@2245 = ~AO raised him after the time of troubles for remaining true to his duty. But, do you worship any god Sheena?~
@2246 = ~The vigilant One, and favored by AO. It tells me your aspirations are honorable.~
@2247 = ~Perhaps, but do you worship any god Sheena?~
@2248 = ~I find it strange that you worship the god that, disguised as the soul stealing sword, Godsbane, helped Cyric to kill Bhaal during the time of troubles.~
@2249 = ~He is the god of thieves. But, do you worship any god Sheena?~
@2250 = ~The raging one. It tells me you have much hatred in you.~
@2251 = ~.~
@2252 = ~One who worships the twin sister of Shar, ever repelling the dark goddess' dominion, can only be praised and commended.~
@2253 = ~Although he wasn't a god, I quite like the story of Tchazzar, Father of Chessenta.~
@2254 = ~Can you tell me more about this- Tchazzar?~
@2255 = ~I've read the story too and I do not wish to hear that story again.~
@2256 = ~Under the leadership of the half god Gilgeam, the great empire of Unther ruled its neighbors including Chessenta for over two millennium.~
@2257 = ~However, this brutal expansion brought with it the hatred of the conquered and bankrupted Unther's treasury, forcing its ruler to raise the taxes to absurd levels.~
@2258 = ~Around 900 AD Chessenta, under the leadership of a new ruler called Tchazzar, rebelled against its master and broke free. It was purported Tchazzar was a red dragon of immense power, in disguise.~
@2259 = ~In 1018 AD, Tchazzar vanished. Some say his disappearance was an attempt to achieve godhood.~
@2260 = ~After Tchazzar's rule, Gilgeam conquered Chessenta again and a new cult worshipping the three headed chromatic queen dragon Tiamat underwent a resurgence in a desperate attempt to throw off Gilgeam's tyrannical yoke.~
@2261 = ~During the time of trouble, Tiamat eventually appeared in a weak incarnation but was slain by Gilgeam.~
@2262 = ~Upon her death, three of the most powerful dragon in the region, including Tchazzar, received part of her essence.~
@2263 = ~Tchazzar felt compelled to seek out Gestaniius a crippled blue wyrm who also received part of Tiamat's divine essence. Upon Gestaniius' death, Tchazzar sprouted a blue head.~
@2264 = ~In his quest to fully absorb Tiamat's divine essence, Tchazzar sought to kill the last recipient, a green dragon named Skuthosiin.~
@2265 = ~After an abrupt transformation that included sprouting a green head, Tchazzar was subsumed by Tiamat and the chromatic divinity was once more manifest in the realms.~
@2266 = ~Tiamat battled Gilgeam once more across the outer planes and in Untherlass, destroying much of the city.~
@2267 = ~Tiamat eventually won, ending Gilgeam's two millennium rule but was much weakened and returned to the alternate planes.~
@2268 = ~You seem quite fond of this story Sheena, if not, then why do you smile?~
@2269 = ~What do you think happened to Tchazzar?~
@2270 = ~Tales involving red dragons rarely speak of honor or saving a city from a neighboring tyrant.~
@2271 = ~Tchazzar, a red dragon in disguise, was an exception in Toril and his deeds remain my favorite tale, an example to be praised and followed.~
@2272 = ~Tchazzar always wanted to achieve godhood. Tchazzar and Tiamat are one.~

@2273 = ~I-I would like to have a word with you, away from prying ears.~ [K#SHEENA]
@2274 = ~I thought I'd never see a half red dragon blushing. Is it so shameful?~
@2275 = ~I overheard your conversation with Mazzy and will listen intently to what you have to say.~
@2276 = ~I overheard your conversation with Mazzy so a conversation won't be necessary. I do not bear the slightest interest in you, Sheena.~
@2277 = ~Is it important?~
@2278 = ~I've rarely seen you so shaken Sheena. Is something wrong?~
@2279 = ~I do blush on some occasions but I want to talk to you about a very serious matter.~
@2280 = ~It may sound peculiar but I developed strong feelings for you, which my heart can no longer keep inside.~
@2281 = ~I believe I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2282 = ~Believing or being sure makes a world of difference, young lady.~
@2283 = ~I share some feelings too, Sheena, but they do not go as deep as yours, I'm afraid.~
@2284 = ~Sorry, Sheena. I'd like to say I share your feeling but... I don't. You will just have to accept it.~
@2285 = ~The way you sometimes looked at me betrayed your feelings long ago. As time went by, I believe I also began having some strong feelings for you but I am not sure - yet - where they might lead us.~
@2286 = ~At times, you are a lovely, adorable and hearty young woman whom my heart would certainly like to hold dear. But I am also repelled by the other you. Sorry, my feelings are too ambiguous to even consider this kind of relationship.~

@2287 = ~What I'm about to say makes me nervous, <CHARNAME>. I've never felt so vulnerable in my entire life and do hope you won't laugh at me.~
@2288 = ~I-I think I love you <CHARNAME>.~
@2289 = ~Believing or being sure makes a world of difference, young girl.~
@2290 = ~I have some feelings too Sheena, but they do not go as deep I'm afraid. Shall we remain friends?~
@2291 = ~The way you sometimes looked at me betrayed your feelings long ago. As time went by, I believe I also began having some strong feelings for you but I am not sure yet where they will lead us.~
@2292 = ~My heart is already bleeding just by opening to you. Please don't add any more wounds by being haughty.~
@2293 = ~I have some feelings too Sheena but they do not go as deep I'm afraid.~
@2294 = ~The way you sometimes looked at me betrayed your feelings long ago. As time went by, I believe I began having some strong feelings for you, but I am not sure yet, where they will lead us.~
@2295 = ~We could try to walk down this path for a while and find out together where it will lead us.~
@2296 = ~We could get to know each other better and share some tender moments together.~
@2297 = ~If you are nurturing some second thoughts, know that what you've given me today has filled my heart with joy, and far more than all my happiest moments patched together.~
@2298 = ~What could possibly make you so happy, Sheena?~
@2299 = ~On second thought, I believe I cannot enter a relationship with you. Sorry, Sheena...Shall we remain friends?~
@2300 = ~(Take Sheena's hand). Let's walk together for a while.~
@2301 = ~I would never have believed a <PRO_RACE> could find me attractive and always thought I'd be doomed to marry one of my own kind.~
@2302 = ~Today, you proved me how wrong I was and let a ray of hope enter my existence.~
@2303 = ~On second thought, I believe that I cannot enter a relationship with you. Sorry, Sheena...Shall we remain friends?~
@2304 = ~I don't intend to bend your will. You've already given me much more than I deserved.~
@2305 = ~You much deserve to find someone that will love you, but I cannot be that 'someone'. Sorry, Sheena.~
@2306 = ~(Sheena leans her head on your shoulder, her auburn hair tickling your neck, breathing softly as you walk together in silence).~
@2307 = ~(Sheena suddenly breaks free, only to place her hands around your neck, her eyes alight by passion, her blazing red lips partly open seek your embrace).~
@2308 = ~(Kiss Sheena passionately).~
@2309 = ~(Place your hand on Sheena's lips). Sorry, I cannot.~

@2310 = ~It does not call for an apology. I will cherish this moment, dearly.~
@2311 = ~Oh my! You did! I've never felt so embarrassed in my entire life. Please tell me this isn't something everybody already knows about or laughs at.~
@2312 = ~Calm down Sheena, your secret will be well kept if you promise me to bury that foolish idea.~
@2313 = ~I share some feelings too Sheena, but they do not go as deep.~
@2314 = ~The way you sometimes looked at me betrayed your feelings long ago. As time went by, I believe I also began having some feelings for you, but I am not sure yet, where they will lead us.~
@2315 = ~Oh my! You did! I've never felt so embarrassed and vulnerable in my entire life. I wish I would die right now.~
@2316 = ~Your secret will be well kept if you promise me to bury this foolish idea.~
@2317 = ~You are a half dragon Sheena, and I find your heritage despicable.~
@2318 = ~I will try <CHARNAME>, though it will be harder than you think.~
@2319 = ~I've asked for your love but received your scorn instead.~
@2320 = ~I think you are being unfair!~
@2321 = ~Well, it would be far better if I left you and before being further embarrassed.~
@2322 = ~At least, you are being honest. Although it is much appreciated, it fails to assuage my grief.~
@2323 = ~Aye, I'd rather keep you as a friend than leave your company <CHARNAME>.~
@2324 = ~I love you <CHARNAME>.~ [K#Sheena]
@2325 = ~Is that it?~
@2326 = ~It really falls short of a true love declaration. I expected something really witty, especially from a seemingly intelligent woman.~
@2327 = ~I had greater expectations and really hoped to see your true feelings.~
@2328 = ~I feel a flame in my heart, alighting a fiery passion in its blaze, burning my every desire to ashes, except to be with you. A flame, yearning to hold you close, until its last breath.~
@2329 = ~(Remain silent).~
@2330 = ~Your fire immunity serves you particularly well today. It seems you are about to set yourself on fire.~
@2331 = ~I find myself unmoved by your pathetic attempt to stir up my emotions. It would have been much better if you had chosen to remain silent.~
@2332 = ~The earth could crumble, the sky fall and the ocean dry, but my love for thee will never die.~
@2333 = ~Your muse favors you with an unusual ardor today; I'm beginning to believe you really love me.~
@2334 = ~This world or the next would be too small to contain my love for you, and yet it mysteriously holds in my heart.~
@2335 = ~I've listened to it all and I find myself unmoved by your pathetic attempt to stir up my emotions. It would have been much better if you had remained silent.~
@2336 = ~My lifetime would not suffice describing my undying love for you, yet these three words do: I love you.~
@2337 = ~I love you too Sheena, especially when you serve me such a fiery prose, and display such a remarkable eloquence.~
@2338 = ~And I would lay down my kingdom at your feet Sheena, for no one ever displayed such vibrant feelings towards me.~
@2339 = ~I feel undeserving of your love, for I come to realize that it is so passionate, so wild and unreserved that I am simply put to shame.~
@2340 = ~I've listened to it all and I find myself unmoved by your pathetic little attempt to stir my emotions. It would have been much better if you had remained silent.~
@2341 = ~I've opened my heart at your request, but only receive wickedness in return.~
@2342 = ~You lout! Get away from my sight! You sicken me! Bastard!~
@2343 = ~Please <CHARNAME>, do not disturb my inspiration.~
@2344 = ~You have no idea <CHARNAME>. My inspiration is so strong from the love I bear for you, that I felt carried away.~
@2345 = ~Are my wits the only charm you feel attracted to?~
@2346 = ~I can hardly believe that no other woman has ever touched your heart.~
@2347 = ~Do not be ashamed of yourself. I feel my love will be strong enough for both of us.~

@2348 = ~I feel this is all wrong <CHARNAME>. I mean, you and I together - it is a dream, just a fleeting dream. Shouldn't we have kept it that way?~ [K#Sheena]
@2349 = ~A dream which has become a reality Sheena, so don't you dare to back out of it now.~
@2350 = ~I love you Sheena and would have no other woman by my side but you.~
@2351 = ~You are right. Perhaps, I was chasing some wild chimera, Sheena.~
@2352 = ~If you do not believe in your own dreams, Sheena, how can I possibly stay with you?~
@2353 = ~But I am a half dragon <CHARNAME>.~
@2354 = ~Where will this lead us to? Ultimately a child, with wings and claws, and who will have also to bear the title of spawn of Bhaal?~
@2355 = ~You did not seem to live an unhappy childhood, so why would our child be different?~
@2356 = ~Why don't we simply enjoy these peaceful moments? Do we really need to talk about a child and what our future might hold?~
@2357 = ~But then, there is also this issue of how others look at us. Oh, <CHARNAME>, won't you understand?~
@2358 = ~Each of us is entitled to an opinion. So, what others might or might not think of our relationship does not bother me.~
@2359 = ~I do. If you want to put an end to this relationship, then fine!~
@2360 = ~I understand you want to throw it all away, because you are afraid I might put an end to this relationship in the near future.~
@2361 = ~Yes. Our future is exactly what I meant. I did not enter into a relationship with you for a fling. I seek much more.~
@2362 = ~I am now unsure that it will ever be possible, <CHARNAME>.~
@2363 = ~Who can assure anyone of a safe future? Life is a risk and our choices have consequences. All I can really add is, my emotions for you are real.~
@2364 = ~Sorry, I can not make any long term commitment, especially under the present circumstances.~
@2365 = ~Your words are comforting, but tell me, what is it *you* really saw in me?~
@2366 = ~My heart is simply at a loss in trying to make sense of it.~
@2367 = ~And so is mine Sheena. Feelings for each other simply happened but cannot be explained. Shouldn't you just be happy and try to cherish this moment?~
@2368 = ~Then the loss is mine. I don't think I can put up with you any longer.~
@2369 = ~I've fallen deeply in love with you, probing into my heart is unnecessary.~
@2370 = ~Have you thoroughly probed your heart or simply scratched the surface of your feelings? I wonder why you've entered into this relationship.~
@2371 = ~You will live a far happier life in love with one of your own kind. I have no regret taking this decision.~
@2372 = ~If I held an answer to your question, I would be blessed. But tell me, what is it *you* really saw in me?~
@2373 = ~You want to throw it all away because you are afraid I might put an end to this relationship in the near future.~
@2374 = ~Hold me in your arms, <CHARNAME>.~
@2375 = ~I-I don't know what to say.~
@2376 = ~(Kiss Sheena).~
@2377 = ~You don't have to say anything.~
@2378 = ~(Sheena returns your kiss passionately).~
@2379 = ~Thank you <CHARNAME>. I am beginning to believe.~
@2380 = ~The heart of a red dragon is fascinating. It is whispered that if a red dragon ever was to give part of its heart willingly, it will hold the power to give life back to his chosen one, even when the most potent spell would likely fail.~
@2381 = ~I want to give you part of my heart <CHARNAME>, as an expression of my true love and my gratitude for yours.~
@2382 = ~May your heart and mine be one for all eternity.~ [K#Sheena]
@2383 = ~I-I can't accept Sheena. It seems so improper.~
@2384 = ~Have you lost your mind? You'd mutilate part of your heart to prove your love to me!~
@2385 = ~You are not a red dragon Sheena, so how do you know your heart holds the same potency?~
@2386 = ~I am honored Sheena, though won't you feel any pain and won't this process bear any risk for you?~
@2387 = ~I find your idea disgusting. Besides, I will not have my chest opened for some crazed experiment that may kill us both.~
@2388 = ~Is this some kind of dragon wedding ritual you are luring me into?~
@2389 = ~Is your love so hesitant it can not see this is a selfless act of love, an unswerving dedication to always love you and to remain faithful and true to you?~
@2390 = ~Is this some kind of dragon wedding ritual you are luring me into?~
@2391 = ~I am honored Sheena, though won't you feel any pain or won't this process bear any risk for you?~
@2392 = ~Yes, I'll give part of myself to you because I simply love you, and it calls for a selfless act of equal proportion.~
@2393 = ~I can feel its power in me as much as you can feel the power of the god Bhaal in you.~
@2394 = ~Accept my gift <CHARNAME>, nothing would ever please me more.~

@2396 = ~Then I accept Sheena if only to please you.~
@2397 = ~I love you far too much for wanting you to take such a risk, Sheena.~
@2398 = ~A wedding compares nothing to what I offer you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2399 = ~It is a lifetime bond that can only pass away with the death of one of us.~
@2400 = ~Our wedding ritual IS a lifetime bond, with the promise to remain faithful and true before the gods. What's the difference?~
@2401 = ~I can not commit myself in that way, not in such a manner that it would tie my life to yours, especially so soon.~
@2402 = ~After the ritual, if I die, you die. If you die, I die. What bond could possibly be stronger than to tie your life and fate to the person you love?~

@2386 = ~I am... truly honoured, Sheena, but will it be painful? Won't the process bear risk to you?~
@2387 = ~What a repulsive idea. I will not have my chest opened for some crazed experiment which could kill us both.~
@2388 = ~Is this some kind of dragon wedding ritual you're luring me into?~
@2389 = ~Is your love so hesitant it cannot see this is a selfless act of love, an unswerving dedication to always love you and to remain faithful and true to you?~

@2396 = ~Then I accept, Sheena, if only to please you.~
@2397 = ~I love you far too much to want you to take such a risk, Sheena.~
@2398 = ~A wedding simply does not compare with what I offer you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2399 = ~It is a lifelong bond that can only end with death, whether it be yours, or mine.~
@2400 = ~Our wedding ritual IS a lifelong bond, with the promise to remain faithful and true before the gods. What's the difference?~
@2401 = ~I cannot commit myself in that way, not in such a manner that it would tie my life to yours, especially so soon.~
@2402 = ~After the ritual, if I die, you die. If you die, I die. What bond could possibly be stronger than to tie your life and fate to the person you love?~
@2403 = ~I did not realize until now what you were really offering me... You are intent on testing my true intentions towards you.~
@2404 = ~Then I shall start the incantation, <CHARNAME>.~
@2405 = ~May our lives be sealed with the heart of the ancient race, and henceforth be one.~
@2406 = ~May Tiamat, queen and goddess of dragons bless our union, in the knowledge my heart is given willingly to <CHARNAME>.~
@2407 = ~Then our relationship must end. I asked for your unconditional love, but you are hesitating, and have proved to me that you are yet to find your chosen one.~
@2408 = ~I've already said yes. I am simply awaiting your answer.~
@2409 = ~Then I accept, Sheena, if only to please the woman I love.~
@2410 = ~Half dragons have an unfaltering dedication toward their chosen one. It is the way I am.~
@2411 = ~You've been raised by humans and your mother was one. Can't we just have a normal relationship without resorting to some draconic ritual?~
@2412 = ~I cannot commit myself to the ways of half-dragons. I am a <PRO_RACE>.~
@2413 = ~Then I accept, Sheena. May our fates be sealed with our love.~
@2414 = ~I wish I knew another way to express my love, another way for us to remain together... but alas, my half dragon heart will suffer no other commitment than the one it longs for.~
@2415 = ~I'm sorry, but I cannot commit myself to the ways of half-dragons. I am a <PRO_RACE>.~
@2416 = ~(Sheena is shaking in spasms and her teeth are chattering fiercely.) I'm soaked and terribly cold... Why don't you get a fire going, my love?~ [K#Sheena]
@2417 = ~Of course, right away. (Pile up some wood).~
@2418 = ~I can hold you in my arms if you feel cold.~
@2419 = ~I'm not your slave, do it yourself!~
@2420 = ~(Sheena uses her burning hands to set the pile of wood alight.) There, it should keep us warm and cosy.~
@2421 = ~Maybe you should undress. I have a blanket to keep you dry and warm.~
@2422 = ~You are wet, too. I doubt it will be of any help.~
@2423 = ~Of course. (Pile up some wood).~
@2424 = ~Then *you* should get the fire going.~
@2425 = ~Should women do all the chores? Perhaps I should throw a fireball at you to keep you warm, you oafish lout!~
@2426 = ~You should undress too. Your blanket is large enough to hold us both.~
@2427 = ~(As Sheena undresses shamelessly in front of you, you admire her finely shaped body.)~
@2428 = ~(Shadows from the fire flicker over her beautifully narrow torso. Her tousled, wet hair falls in waves over her shoulders, brilliant red in the firelight.)~
@2429 = ~(The slight trembling of her stomach ripples the honey sheen of her skin and the soft down of her belly and thighs, the tones shifting imperceptibly like candlelight on a satin dress.)~
@2430 = ~(Goose bumps mingle with her freckles, but her breathing is now controlled and the shivering has almost stopped.)~
@2431 = ~Can I have that blanket now?~
@2432 = ~(Wrap Sheena with the blanket, then undress.)~
@2433 = ~You need a shell and some tritons behind you. Quite lovely.~
@2434 = ~Come with me, my darling. I wouldn't want you to catch cold, and besides, I feel the need to hold you in my arms as soon as I can...~
@2435 = ~If you think I'm going to stay all the long night naked so you may paint my portrait or gaze adoringly, you are plainly mistaken. If so, I may withdraw my offer to share the blanket with you. Now, what will it be?~
@2436 = ~The blanket is mine and I'm rather enjoying the view.~
@2437 = ~(Sheena pulls her own blanket out of her backpack.) Well, it seems you prefer to sleep alone after all. Good night, darling.~
@2438 = ~(Sheena lays quietly, her head on your chest, embracing you comfortably.)~ [K#Sheena]
@2439 = ~(Run your fingers along her cheekbone.)~
@2440 = ~Wake up, Sheena. Wake up.~
@2441 = ~(Sheena's nose quivers slightly under your light touch, but she is still sound asleep.)~
@2442 = ~(Tickle Sheena.)~
@2443 = ~(Kiss Sheena's forehead.)~
@2444 = ~What!?~
@2445 = ~Sorry, you frightened me. I thought we were facing yet another ambush in the middle of the night.~
@2446 = ~*My* ambush was carefully prepared, and began as soon as I proposed to share my blanket with you.~
@2447 = ~(Sheena keeps her eyes closed.) Kiss me, my love... ~
@2448 = ~(Kiss Sheena ardently.)~
@2449 = ~(Kiss Sheena's cheek.) Time to get up, Sheena. A brave new world awaits us.~
@2450 = ~Hey! Why are you tickling me?~
@2451 = ~It is high time to go, and you seem unusually lethargic this morning.~
@2452 = ~Your ambush and later conquest is one I surrendered myself willingly to; and what a pleasurable capitulation you have treated me to, as well.~
@2453 = ~I do not regret a single moment with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@2454 = ~(Sheena starts to tickle underneath your armpits.) You lout! I'll teach you how to properly tickle someone.~
@2455 = ~I wonder what my stepfather would think of us, of both our relationship and the harsh life on the road I currently live.~ [K#Sheena]
@2456 = ~You imposed the marriage upon us. I willingly agreed. Of course, I also assume that if we ever meet him, you will explain it was your intent.~
@2457 = ~From your tales, I imagine he will be pleased if you are happy. Are you not?~
@2458 = ~Oh yes! There is not one moment I regret my choice.~
@2459 = ~I killed your real father. Do you not sometimes bear any ill thought toward me?~
@2460 = ~You did what you had to. Besides, he was evil.~
@2461 = ~His knowledge could have been useful, as I am still pondering what my half dragon future might hold.~
@2462 = ~I've never found anyone able to tell me if I'll always stay a half dragon, or if I'll eventually grow much bigger, and turn into a red dragon like my real father.~
@2463 = ~That thought frightens me.~
@2464 = ~It is doubtful you ever will- I imagine all children of draconic descent bear the same features as their parents. Besides, I need not to remind you that you are partly human.~
@2465 = ~Even if you did, you would still be Sheena, and I would still love you. Always.~
@2466 = ~Why bother about it when you can remain in human form as long as you wish?~
@2467 = ~Are you afraid of him? That would sound strange coming from the son of the Lord of Murder, a man gifted with more powers than anyone else could possibly hold.~
@2468 = ~I am certainly not afraid. I simply wouldn't want to give him the impression I abducted you.~
@2469 = ~Should I be afraid?~
@2470 = ~I'll tell him how bravely you released me from the clutches of my real father.~
@2471 = ~Do you think about him, sometimes? I mean, your real father.~
@2472 = ~His knowledge could have been useful, if not invaluable. I still wonder what my half dragon future might hold.~
@2473 = ~Why bother about it when you can remain in human form as long as you wish?~
@2474 = ~What you say is true. But then, my ability to be fully human at will is unnatural- at least, from what I've read in books about half dragons.~
@2475 = ~I have also noticed my half dragon form has slightly changed. More scales cover the remains of its human part, and I also feel I have grown a little bigger.~
@2476 = ~Even if your worst nightmare became true, you would still be Sheena, and I would still love you.~
@2477 = ~I had not realized until now I was married to a red dragon. Should I run for my life right away or wait until you shout 'Boo'?~
@2478 = ~Maybe it would be wise to buy more potions of fire resistance at the next shop.~
@2479 = ~Thank you, my love, for your comforting words. I wish they also assuaged my fears, but... it is in vain.~
@2480 = ~Why do you make fun of me when this is a very serious matter?~
@2481 = ~Half dragons are considered a meagre trophy and are widely ignored, but every band of adventurers would be on my heels if I *became* a red dragon.~
@2482 = ~They would have to face the slayer, too. I doubt any of them could last more than two minutes against our combined might.~
@2483 = ~I will fight them at your side, Sheena. I doubt any of them could last more than two minutes against our combined might.~
@2484 = ~We'll deal with it when it happens. For now, you should bury that foolishness about becoming a dragon, and remain focused on the tasks ahead of us.~
@2485 = ~A reassuring thought, my love, for now.~
@2486 = ~I shall do as you say, my love.~

@2487 = ~I'm sorry, I seem to have failed to notice you earlier... you're so small... are you a child?~
@2488 = ~(Laugh) I am a Halfling.~
@2489 = ~I've heard of such a race, but I have never seen one of your kind before. If you're as brave as you are small, as it is rumoured, then we haven't much to fear from our enemies.~
@2490 = ~One can try to be brave, but only battles will tell, I think.~
@2491 = ~You speak the words of wisdom itself. I'll surely keep an eye on you on the battlefield.~
@2492 = ~Thank you, Sheena, but that won't be necessary. I am quite able to fend for myself.~
@2493 = ~Sorry Mazzy, I didn't mean to offend you. I keep clumsily bringing your height up... You have been patient with me beyond words.~
@2494 = ~You can be vexing at times, but I know your remarks are devoid of any malice. Do not worry yourself, Sheena.~
@2495 = ~You haven't spoken to me once since we first met... Is there something wrong?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2496 = ~Mazzy, I will never question your prowess in combat again. You may be small, but you are a great warrior.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2497 = ~I think myself undeserving of such a compliment when I think of my fallen comrades. Sometimes I... I wish I had joined them in death.~
@2498 = ~Even the most powerful warriors fall by the hand of fate. Providence saved you. Console yourself with the great deeds you can still accomplish in their names.~
@2499 = ~An idea first born from seeing their dead bodies, but it has been long since I have thought about it, it is true.~
@2500 = ~Each evil slain honours their memory, their courage, and certainly helps Faerun to be a better place. Wouldn't they agree that you should keep fighting and not succumb to melancholy and despair?~
@2501 = ~Thank you, Sheena. Sometimes I find it hard to see when I am falling into melancholy- I should forget such foolishness, and fight with their names in my heart.~
@2502 = ~Is there a Halfling you hold dear to your heart, Mazzy?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2503 = ~Patrick was dear to me, but our adventures eventually cost him his life. I think of him often.~
@2504 = ~Adventure is hardly propitious in helping one find a soul mate - or keeping one, it seems.~
@2505 = ~Travelling gives us every opportunity to meet new people- something it is unlikely you would achieve if you stayed in one place.~
@2506 = ~Those new people always remain perfect strangers, their faces slowly disappearing from our memories with the passage of time. It is always the same.~
@2507 = ~Don't you have at least a little faith in fate?~
@2508 = ~You mean like finding a beautiful, sensitive, caring and loving half dragon knocking on my bedroom door tonight?~
@2509 = ~Obviously your wishful thinking far exceeds my Halfling imagination, heh. I meant the odds of finding a half dragon will be far better travelling than if you stay in the secluded mountains.~
@2510 = ~The odds that he would try to kill us before asking my hand are also much, much more favorable. It doesn't mean I have given up all hope, but my prospects could *not* be gloomier, Mazzy.~
@2511 = ~Why focus on your own kind? Your disguise is not unpleasing to the eye.~
@2512 = ~Are you suggesting I start a serious relationship based on a deceit?~
@2513 = ~You could always reveal yourself before anything becomes too serious. At least you could say you tried, rather than moping around as you currently are.~
@2514 = ~I'll need more time to get used to such an extravagant idea, I think.~
@2515 = ~I have been carefully considering what you suggested the other day.~ [K#Sheena]
@2516 = ~And? Did you reach a conclusion?~
@2517 = ~My heart tells me this is awfully wrong, but yet still it yearns for love.~
@2518 = ~But there is more to it, Mazzy. At the same time, I've been considering someone-~
@2519 = ~You are full of surprises, Sheena, and I am dying to know who that *someone* might be. Anyone I know?~
@2520 = ~Well... nobody else seems to be listening, so I should as well lighten my heart and share my secret with you.~
@2521 = ~The man of my heart is <CHARNAME>.~
@2522 = ~By Arvoreen's sword- why do you feel attracted to a man that bears more pain and struggles than any other mortal could possibly endure?~
@2523 = ~He has been kind to me. It is... quite difficult to explain beyond that.~
@2524 = ~I am simply at a loss trying to explain the matters of my heart.~
@2525 = ~Keeping this secret hidden will only soften your heart at a time in which you need to be strong. You should open your heart and tell him how you feel.~
@2526 = ~What if he rejects me?~
@2527 = ~You won't know until you try. Sometimes, it is better to run head-on into the battle, and simply hope it will turn out in your favor.~
@2528 = ~It is going to be hard, but I'll try to muster the courage.~

@2529 = ~Your fair-mindedness equals the ugliness of your dragon kin. A remarkable trait few would come to expect from Lord Jierdan Firkraag's daughter.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2530 = ~A compliment disguised as abuse is unworthy of a *would be* knight's chivalry. But then, you are no knight, Anomen.~
@2531 = ~Forgive me, Sheena, I meant no offence. I am simply worried that I may fail my test, and that I may not become a Knight.~
@2532 = ~You have noble aspirations, Anomen, but don't let them become clouded by anger, mockery or despair.~
@2533 = ~Aye Sheena, sensible advice. I will... I will think on your words.~
@2534 = ~Fulfilling at long last your aspirations must fill your heart with joy. I would most certainly like to congratulate you on this occasion, Sir Anomen.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2535 = ~Aye, it is true joy I feel on this day. But tell me, Sheena: do you only revel in other's achievements, or do you yourself have some secret aspiration?~
@2536 = ~I have desires of my own, Anomen, but have not yet found any grand design I feel comfortable dedicating myself to.~
@2537 = ~Like all of us, you've committed yourself to <CHARNAME>'s cause. Somehow- perhaps unknowingly- you have found a worthy quest.~
@2538 = ~It would certainly look that way, but it is in the service of another and not of my own. Your achievement was clearly your own making.~
@2539 = ~I do not deny the merits of my unswerving and dedicated friends in my own accomplishment. So let me ask you a question, Sheena - do you think I would have succeeded without their friendship and support?~
@2540 = ~Maybe not. But who am I to say? One could also point out that the reward is fully yours, and that your friends were mere observers of your success.~
@2541 = ~By becoming a knight and fulfilling my long time desire, I simply placed myself in the service of the Order. I believe abnegation can prove just as rewarding if pursued for a noble cause.~
@2542 = ~You make me feel somewhat selfish, I have to admit, Sir Anomen. Would you recommend abnegation to everyone, or do you feel some of us have the right to pursue their own dreams?~
@2543 = ~This is an unfair trial, Sheena. Everyone is, of course, entitled to pursue whatever aspiration he or she feels attuned to.~
@2544 = ~I feel somehow relieved you have said so. With time, perhaps, I will find my own aspirations. Meanwhile, I will try as you said, and settle for abnegation in the hope that travelling with <CHARNAME> will bring just rewards along the way.~
@2545 = ~You'd fail to consider my type of nobility worthy of your attention.~
@2546 = ~Nobility is a gift bestowed on you. You should uphold the moral values which were carved in by your forefathers.~
@2547 = ~By now, I'm sure you have heard of Lord Jierdan since you played a part in his downfall.~
@2548 = ~Ever heard of a Lord Jierdan?~
@2549 = ~One of the worst fights I was subjected to, but... did I miss something?~
@2550 = ~A despicable man with poor manners and few friends. And then I heard this incredible rumour, that HE was a dragon.~
@2551 = ~Obviously, the entirety of the conversation with <CHARNAME> I had when I first met him. Well, the only blood of noble origin running through my veins is Lord Jierdan's. If I listened to your advice, I would roam the land and terrorize innocent people spreading death and chaos.~
@2552 = ~I believe I summarized well the noble values of my late father.~
@2553 = ~Well, the only blood of noble origin running through my veins is Lord Jierdan's. If I listened to your advice, I would roam the land and terrorize innocent people, spreading death and chaos wherever I went.~
@2554 = ~<CHARNAME> told me you also have noble origins, and that I should speak to you at once.~ [K#SHEEN1]

@2555 = ~Tell me Cernd, I smell an earthy, somewhat musty scent in these woods; could it be from all those mushrooms sprouting from the ground?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2556 = ~Yes, Sheena. I've spotted a few comestible specimens over yonder. Their life is fettered to this great oak, and will bud each season at the same exact spot. Can there ever be anything more truly wonderful than nature?~
@2557 = ~Nature is far too whimsical to be trusted. She provided me with a cursed appearance, and part of me will neither forget nor forgive her.~
@2558 = ~Your hatred for yourself is akin to the rot in a tree trunk which will only weaken you in a time when you need to be strong.~
@2559 = ~The beast within keeps me strong, Cernd. I have to fight its vicious urges and lust for power almost daily.~
@2560 = ~Your mind fights for the path it has chosen, and not the one nature gave you. In one careless moment, your step could falter and you will realize you have fought all those battles in vain.~
@2561 = ~Embrace what nature gave you rather than fight it, and finally achieve the balance you are longing for.~
@2562 = ~I am two opposites that, like water and fire, can never be brought together. Both of them battle for its own right to exist, and though neither wish it, their dispute can only be settled trough my own death.~

@2563 = ~Sorry Korgan, I'll try my best to keep them off your face.~
@2564 = ~Yer pathetic excuses won't do next time, so ye'd better watch yer back. Ye could find me axe sticking out of it.~
@2565 = ~I heard you the first time, dwarf, so there is no need for you to be rude. One piece of advice, however; don't stand too close to a half dragon if you want to remain unscathed.~
@2566 = ~Can't you keep yer bloody flappy wings off my face? Tis gettin' increasingly annoying and my blade is itching fer a swing at them!~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2567 = ~You did not learn the first lesson, dwarf! Don't stand too close to a half dragon!~
@2568 = ~Blasted pestering long limbed half dragon, I'll cut yer nails and toes if tis' a fight ye want? ~
@2569 = ~And I would have cut off your head - dwarf - if it wasn't standing so close to the ground.~
@2570 = ~Ouch, why did ye hit me with yer bloody tail?~ [K#SHEEN1]

@2571 = ~You seem displeased by my presence, Aerie; why else would you stare at my wings so?~ [K#Sheen1]
@2572 = ~Oh no, Sheena, I-I have nothing against you... only that... you are a bitter reminder of the loss of my wings.~
@2573 = ~I would gladly offer them to you were such wizardry ever possible.~
@2574 = ~Thank you for your kind words, Sheena, but... why would you want your wings to be cut off?~
@2575 = ~They are my own reminder of an abomination that took place a quarter of a century ago.~
@2576 = ~W-what happened so long ago?~
@2577 = ~I was born.~
@2578 = ~I've always dreamed of visiting the Avariel and their cities perched high up in the mountains, but always dreaded the welcome I would in all likelihood receive.~ [K#Sheen1]
@2579 = ~Most of my people were killed by dragons before the first flowering. I-I'm afraid you are right. Our great winged warriors would likely pierce your chest with their glass swords before they'd even allow you to utter a word.~
@2580 = ~Once this adventure is over, what about travelling there together, Aerie? You could be my guide and spokeswoman whilst I would be the wings carrying you home.~
@2581 = ~I-I don't know Sheena. My memory of that place is hazy... I'm not sure I could find my way back through the mountains.~
@2582 = ~You'll just need to point out the way, and I'll try to spot your kinfolk from the sky.~
@2583 = ~Oh, it would be really the most blessed day of my life, Sheena. Would you really help me see my people again?~
@2584 = ~Let Aerdrie-Faenya strike me down if I fail to keep the promise I make to you on this day, Aerie.~
@2585 = ~Do you worship the goddess of the Avariel?~
@2586 = ~No. But I secretly hope that if I stay true to my word, she will protect me on the day we see the great winged warriors and their glass swords.~

@2587 = ~Tell me Viconia, what business could a drow elf possibly have on the surface?~ [K#Sheen1]
@2588 = ~None I would share with you, but then, I am curious to know why you left your lair, half dragon.~
@2589 = ~(It seems this isn't going to be a friendly conversation, then...) We could perhaps fill our time with countless, insipid insults but it would certainly lower us both, don't you agree?~
@2590 = ~I am certainly not in the mood for befriending a half dragon, and approve of your only wise judgment thus far, in that you should keep your mouth shut.~
@2591 = ~My curiosity for drow culture overcomes my inner reluctance to ask you questions, Viconia. And if you would listen-~ [K#Sheen1]
@2592 = ~Get on with it. If such a question is unavoidable, spit it out, do not stand there like some dumb simpleton.~
@2593 = ~I thought all drow worshipped Lolth, and only Lolth - the spider queen- and yet, you often speak of Shar. Are you a cleric of Shar?~
@2594 = ~The spider queen has sworn my death and left me with no other choice but to turn my faith to the dark goddess.~
@2595 = ~I know of the dark twin of Selune all too well. Why did you not take refuge in one of Shar's churches instead of walking needlessly into Athkatla?~
@2596 = ~You know much about Shar, but then, you should also know I won't share any secrets with you.~
@2597 = ~Yes, given the intricacy of your clergy, I should certainly be wary if not fearful of your ultimate motives.~
@2598 = ~I owe my life to <CHARNAME>, and do not covet his downfall if that is your intended meaning, drill vel'bol d' dos kitrye phish maelthra.~
@2599 = ~I will take you at your word... for now.~
@2600 = ~She did not. My knowledge comes from your clergy, too prompt to see my powers and appearance as a gift, worthy of either a sacrifice or an enrollment into the service of Shar.~
@2601 = ~I would have chosen the sacrifice; your draconic heart would have brought the dark goddess much joy, I am sure.~
@2602 = ~Evil, jealousy, and hatred - are they not her traits? All three... *virtues*... fit you like a glove.~
@2603 = ~Flattery will be to no purpose, my *dear* dragonling.~
@2604 = ~I wasn't dispensing any, and certainly not toward you.~
@2605 = ~Tell me, Sheena, did the dark goddess ever attempt to sway your heart to her worship?~ [K#SHEEN1]

@2606 = ~No- and you survived?!~
@2607 = ~Well, does it sound so strange to you that - against all odds - an all powerful gnome survived a mighty dragon?~
@2608 = ~Well, yes. I'd be interested in hearing the full tale.~
@2609 = ~I just told you it.~
@2610 = ~When?~
@2611 = ~Just now.~
@2612 = ~(Laugh) I am only a half dragon, Jan.~
@2613 = ~Who cares now? In ten years, the story will say you were forty foot tall and breathing the sun's fire.~
@2614 = ~Sheena, did I ever tell you I faced a dragon once, alone?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2615 = ~Sheena, did I ever tell you about my aunt Petunia and her shadow dragon?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2616 = ~I recall your aunt's story. According to Jan, she had a shadow dragon named Blackie trained to roll over, play dead and fetch dwarves?~
@2617 = ~You surely know how to tell a good story Valygar, and how to spoil it faster than a Jan Jansen's Flasher Master Bruiser Mate. Don't listen to that inept tale spinner, Sheena. I have a far better tale for you. ~
@2618 = ~Let me guess, does your story comprise wyverns, griffins, gargoyles or maybe harpies?~
@2619 = ~Ah! I am exposed!~

@2620 = ~What kind of animal are you holding in your hands, Minsc?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2621 = ~Ah! You haven't met my hamster yet. Let me introduce you to Boo.~
@2622 = ~Boo can talk?~
@2623 = ~Of course he can. Actually, he was wondering, given you have wings, whether you could fly him to the moon?~
@2624 = ~Well, I'll try my best to please your fluffy friend... tell him to make an appointment tonight. As you can see the sun veils the moon right now.~
@2625 = ~(That poor fellow has but a nut in his head in place of his brain.)~
@2626 = ~So Minsc, what does Boo think of half dragons?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2627 = ~Boo says you have a big sword, and know all about kicking the vile butt of evil. Also, you are the nicest half dragon he's ever met!~
@2628 = ~He's met another half dragon before?!~
@2629 = ~No, but Boo says he met a nasty lizard once that slapped him with his tail. Given his size, it was close enough to resemble a half dragon, don't you think?~
@2630 = ~What!? Did it have wings?~
@2631 = ~No, but when I kicked its butt for slapping Boo, it did learn to fly!~

@2632 = ~Keldorn, my presence seems to make you edgy. Have you ever seen any of my kind before?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2633 = ~During my career with the Order of the Radiant Heart, I had every opportunity to meet new creatures. Most dragons I met did not survive long enough to tell their part of the tale.~
@2634 = ~And did you take great pride in slaying them mercilessly?~
@2635 = ~They were evil and I don't feel the slightest remorse, Sheena. Do not expect me to stray from the path laid out for me by the Order. I shall always abide by their rules and values.~
@2636 = ~I have a few tales from my own kind which would point out that humans are a greater evil. They encroach on their habitat, pleading for the dragon's protection, swearing that they only want to farm and nourish their families, only to try to kill him at the first convenient opportunity.~
@2637 = ~Your draconic lineage blinds you from seeing the truth. Evil must be slain.~
@2638 = ~Far from it, Keldorn, I loathe most dragons, including myself, but cannot stand the great injustice that is done to them.~
@2639 = ~(Growl) They have the blood of innocent people on their claws!~
@2640 = ~Humans should stay away from dragons' lairs. It seems to *me* they go to great lengths in search of trouble.~
@2641 = ~Keldorn, is your wife a dragon, or perhaps a troll? Why else would you leave her for so many moons?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2642 = ~This is a rather appalling attempt to mar my mood, is it not? My wife is my own affair, and you would do well to remain silent.~
@2643 = ~Oh well, as long as you don't slay her in your sleep, mistaking her for a dragon, then you can go on pretending to be the perfect husband.~
@2644 = ~How dare you!~
@2645 = ~I don't like your glare, Keldorn. It says too much on how you feel about me and my kindred. I seek no quarrel nor want your friendship, but stop staring at me as if I were a demon you feel compelled to destroy.~
@2646 = ~We are travelling together and share the same interest in <CHARNAME>'s cause, so at least, show me some civility and I will spare you these uncouth remarks.~
@2647 = ~Very well, let us shake hands and speak of it no more.~
@2648 = ~Despite your lineage to a vicious beast who destroyed some of the best members of my Order, I have come to realize you share none of his wickedness.~
@2649 = ~Social factors also come into play; isn't it what they say about someone's personality?~
@2650 = ~Good guidance is an essential part in raising a child, I cannot deny it.~
@2651 = ~Then, you should be there more often for your daughter before you find her married, or worse - adventuring.~
@2652 = ~Admittedly, that is an excellent point. I'd hate to see her follow my path. I have worked hard and endured much so she could enjoy a better life than mine.~
@2653 = ~You may have trouble bending her will if you don't stay close to her heart.~
@2654 = ~She is still young, and the odds she would choose to become an adventurer are slim. Besides, I promised myself this would be my last adventure.~
@2655 = ~I seem to recall from our last conversation that you are contemplating retirement, Keldorn.~
@2656 = ~I just wonder if your will can really so easily give up a life of adventure, and settle down to a comfortable yet boring life.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2657 = ~The word retirement does not imply that I intend to remain useless. I have served the Order all my life and will remain in its service until my last breath. Even though my body will be too old and weak to fight, I could still train young paladins and advise our council.~
@2658 = ~Don't forget your wife and daughter back home. I see you are quite capable of neglecting them, even when you have the time to see them.~
@2659 = ~Your thoughtfulness for my own family tells me you are longing for establishing one of your own.~
@2660 = ~A dream, Keldorn, just a dream.~
@2661 = ~Hope is what keeps all of us alive. Hold onto it, Sheena.~

@2662 = ~Your brother is a wonderful being, Imoen.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2663 = ~Yes, but I still have trouble understanding why he chose to befriend a, a dragon, like you.~
@2664 = ~If I were a dragon, your brother would have probably slain me on the day he found me in that rotting cage, right where I stood.~
@2665 = ~Yes. It's been very strange since <CHARNAME> and I left Candlekeep. I feel almost like I'm losing grip on reality after... after what happened~
@2666 = ~You suffered a great deal, not to mention the loss of your soul... it is not particularly surprising.~
@2667 = ~I'm sure <CHARNAME> will find a way to help you... for both our sakes.~
@2668 = ~We shall all do our best to help you.~
@2669 = ~That belt around your waist looks really tight; does it not suffocate you, Imoen?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2670 = ~Don't worry about it. I'm fine with a bee like waist.~
@2671 = ~But I wonder. How does that illusion of yours work? Are you really a human woman in that form? Like... could you bear a child?~
@2672 = ~Before answering your question I'd have to try it first, which is very unlikely.~
@2673 = ~Can I just see your hand for a moment?~
@2674 = ~And why would you want that?~
@2675 = ~But... sure (Sheena extends her hand).~
@2676 = ~Your skin feels as soft, as that of a new born baby and... no calluses. If it came also in a spell version, I'd certainly beg <CHARNAME> for it at the first available store, heh.~
@2677 = ~(laugh) You! You've been graced with beauty and youth, why would you want to turn into an illusion?~
@2678 = ~It's so spellbinding; it reminds me of the beauty of the dryads.~
@2679 = ~I hardly look like one and find this appearance extremely common.~
@2680 = ~On the contrary, I think you look gorgeous.~
@2681 = ~Well, thank you Imoen, but I do not believe so.~

@2682 = ~I wonder why you first chose to become a thief, Nalia. Did you rob the rich to give money back to the poor, or some such fantasy?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2683 = ~That particular grand idea dissipated quite rapidly. I've never been very talented at picking locks and pockets or hiding in dark places.~
@2684 = ~My father was incensed when he first heard of my thieving career, and even threatened to hand me over to the authorities, saying he couldn't outlive the shame I was bringing down on him by perpetrating such crimes.~
@2685 = ~I can barely imagine you penetrating some noble's house in the black of night, searching for some treasure chest or making a grab at the silverware. It seems so out of place for a noblewoman of your standing.~
@2686 = ~Although other nobles have resorted to thievery and larceny on occasion for more evil reasons, my motives were always to help the less fortunate.~
@2687 = ~The cause is noble, but the means is less than commendable. I really wonder if those poor you helped out have really gained a decent life after receiving a handful of coins in their pockets.~
@2688 = ~It is far more likely they drank it all during the night, and reappeared begging on the streets the next morning.~
@2689 = ~If only one wrecked life has regained its dignity, then my actions have not been for naught.~
@2690 = ~From that perspective, you could as well have given all of your loot to just one. Then, followed him up to ensure he spent the newly acquired coins well, and maybe helped him set up his own business so that precariousness never hit the poor man again.~
@2691 = ~There is no way to tell who is more deserving. I've often let fate guide my hand and gave as much as I could spare to every needy commoner I could.~
@2692 = ~Although your actions are honourable, they seem as useless as a drop of fresh water in the ocean to make it less salty.~
@2693 = ~Doing something, however little, is always better than doing nothing.~

@2694 = ~So you assume, Edwin. Maybe I'll see *you* apologize to the ruthless dragon before the end of this conversation.~
@2695 = ~(She wields such a large sword... and with such ease! I must watch out for myself, even if my own prowess is considerable. Yes, she is surely no match for me, but better safe than sorry.) You threaten with size and draconic powers? Very well, if you yield now, I will call it a fair bout.~
@2696 = ~I shall yield for the sake of <CHARNAME>. If <PRO_HESHE> chooses you to be at his side, I won't question <PRO_HISHER> decision, but do not show contempt for my nature ever again.~
@2697 = ~Tell me Sheena, how can one have the noteworthy lineage to a ruthless dragon and be but a pitiful whimpering lass?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2698 = ~Grrr, is it a lesson in flight you seek this time?~
@2699 = ~I am getting used to you, my little dragon. I would certainly enjoy lying on your back, and have you fly me to the heavens.~
@2700 = ~You- you despicable-~
@2701 = ~Don't gasp with erotic anticipation yet, my dragonling.~
@2702 = ~You've gone mad, Edwin. You must have realized it by now, don't you? (His eyes, his eyes... he can't have realised.) Please, is there a benevolent healer willing to cast a remove curse on Edwin?~
@2703 = ~Hahaha... Your beauteous virtues are as legendary as a bag of dirt. I simply enjoyed taunting you with the promise of a true lover.~
@2704 = ~True lover, you say? Don't flatter yourself, Edwin. You are probably as cold and desiccated as your evil manners (I certainly feel relieved he was not chasing some wild chimera, at least.)~

@2705 = ~Sheena, is red your favourite colour, or do you simply exhibit a passion for blushing?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2706 = ~Why do you shy away at my glance, Jaheira?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2707 = ~Your breed is contemptible and does not fit into the natural order, at least not by design.~
@2708 = ~I've dreaded such a despondent insult all my life, for it rings so true. But why unleash such cruelty upon me, Jaheira?~
@2709 = ~I am not swayed by your attempt to make me sympathize with you, creature. Life is harsh, you'll learn to deal with it.~
@2710 = ~And what or whom made you so suddenly change your mind?~
@2711 = ~You maintain a certain balance of character I appreciate. It was unexpected at first sight.~
@2712 = ~Appearances can be deceitful, and mine more than most.~
@2713 = ~Your appearance might be cursed - child, but your heart is blessed. I imagine your parents were loving and compassionate, as I see no trace of hatred towards others.~
@2714 = ~They always tried to make me feel human and never showed any disdain for my appearance. Yes, I look back with fond memories of my childhood.~
@2715 = ~They must be proud of turning you into a compassionate being. I wouldn't dare to imagine such a miracle occuring if fate had placed you in the wrong hands.~
@2716 = ~My first judgment of you has been harsh. Although it would certainly call for an apology, the words to do so do not come to me easily.~ [K#SHEEN1]

@2717 = ~You seem ever so quiet, Valygar.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2718 = ~Of all the foul magic breathers travelling with <CHARNAME>, you sicken me most. Leave, now.~
@2719 = ~Your outburst is unfairly directed, Valygar; where have I erred to draw such hatred?~
@2720 = ~Your damnable soul is more than likely to be corrupted with accursed magic, foul beast- I have reason enough.~
@2721 = ~Your prejudice toward both spellcasters and half dragons is bitter and undeserving. The past of your kindred is darkening both your judgment and your soul.~
@2722 = ~It seems that in your eyes, magic is as contemptible as corruption or murder, but not all of us seek power and domination over others through its use. I try to follow a righteous path with dedication and honor. My magic serves well its purpose to smite evil in battle, and certainly does not incense vile desires in my heart.~
@2723 = ~Awaken from the slumber of your past or crawl back to it, I am done with due civility.~
@2724 = ~...I hope you are right, Sheena. But why would you care?~
@2725 = ~I am accustomed to prejudice, and I have learned to look beyond appearances. I also guess a good soul wounded by its own past could use some healing.~
@2726 = ~Food for thought, Sheena.~
@2727 = ~I find your dark pigmentation extremely attractive, Valygar.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2728 = ~(cough) Hum... thank you for your compliment, Sheena.~
@2729 = ~An oddity that certainly makes you special.~
@2730 = ~Yes... what is the point?~
@2731 = ~Nobody but a woman would understand.~
@2732 = ~I vaguely suspect a prank of some sort.~
@2733 = ~I solemnly swear I am not indulging in any such childish behaviour at this time.~
@2734 = ~It goes without saying. But why suddenly throw this mundane flattery?~
@2735 = ~Forgive me, Valygar. I do not know myself.~

@2736 = ~The journey can be such a bore sometimes. I will listen intently.~
@2737 = ~A long time ago, a wizard attempted a dangerous experiment on his son. Although the son died, the wizard managed to collect his soul and held it using myriad powerful spells in a jar but alas, his son's body was lost forever and could not be resurrected.~
@2738 = ~For three years, the wizard tried to find a way to revive his son and give its soul a countenance. He desperately searched through countless golem manuals and other treatises on the dead, when at last, he found a lengthy tome dealing with resurrecting lost sons.~
@2739 = ~The dark pages of the manual instructed him to give his son a body of flesh and bones which would closely resemble him. The wizard, determined to succeed at bringing his son back, unearthed every fresh grave and collected every body part needed to make his son whole again.~
@2740 = ~Another year had come to pass and the body was finally completed, stitched and sewn to closely resemble that of his son, ready to be revived. In that final moment, the wizard used all of his magical energy to release the soul from the jar to join the newly-created body.~
@2741 = ~At long last, his son awoke from his long slumber.~
@2742 = ~Alas, their embrace would not last. The son saw his own reflection in the mirror and faced his sheer ugliness with horror. He was so horrified by his forbidding appearance that he grabbed his father's dagger and pierced his own heart.~
@2743 = ~Hmmm... I am not exactly enthralled by your tale. I feel it is tainted with scorn aimed at my own appearance.~
@2744 = ~We are all slaves of our own creeds, my dear dragonfly. A story is simply like a gem and has many facets. The first facet you saw, was the one you most wished to see.~
@2745 = ~This sparrow has a tale, perhaps gruesome, but noteworthy of your attention, he believes. Would you like to hear it?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2746 = ~I have been thinking about your tale and any truth it might hold, Haer'Dalis.~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2747 = ~And? Did you reach a conclusion?~
@2748 = ~Truth, much like a diamond, has many brilliant facets, but will only reveal its core if exposed directly to a bright light.~
@2749 = ~Still, every facet is a part of the whole. Your theory about truth holding a core barely contains any common sense.~
@2750 = ~Truth is a whole as much as one cannot equal two. Yet, your eagerness to split truth in half baffles me.~
@2751 = ~My tale involved the perception of the mind where truth can often multiply or divide itself.~
@2752 = ~Some may say the colour black is the most beautiful when others may find it the ugliest.~
@2753 = ~The truth born from your mind's perception of the surrounding world does not hold any universally accepted truth.~
@2754 = ~You have me lost, I must admit. Isn't the world around us real?~
@2755 = ~Worry not, I am as real as you are. The concept is simple. The only absolute truth your mind can grasp is limited to your own mind.~
@2756 = ~A good example would be you think, therefore you are.~
@2757 = ~Yes- I feel, I am. Lost in a forest, looking for a clearing.~

@2758 = ~Sheena, the mighty rogue dragon, you are truly a master of disguise. But for all this subtle camouflage, I suspect a longing for humanity- why else do you persistently wear a human countenance?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2759 = ~Every bounty hunter in Amn would partake in my hunt were I to reveal my true form. Pray that such an event will not occur. You could fall, in a careless moment, into one of their traps.~
@2760 = ~I meant no disparagement, Sheena. Please wipe that frown from your face, it suits your draconic counterpart far better.~
@2761 = ~My disguise shields me from scorn, vilification and occasionally from being stoned to death by the ignorant or uneducated. Since I have now answered your question satisfactorily, I expect you will leave me be.~
@2762 = ~I am still pondering under what appearance would you conceal yourself if Faerun was mostly filled by half dragons.~
@2763 = ~My answer would be obvious, but then you would have to spend the rest of your life hidden in shadows.~
@2764 = ~Tell me, Yoshimo, how did you become a bounty hunter?~ [K#SHEEN1]
@2765 = ~When I was a child, my hands were fairly agile and I could sneak unseen to almost anywhere I wished. Both gifts never left me, and thus I became an accomplished bounty hunter- feared by all and hated by many, I might add.~
@2766 = ~I imagine any petty thief's childhood would be similar to yours. Still, do you enjoy hunting your prey?~
@2767 = ~Ah! A double edged question. Well, the hunt is sometimes far more pleasurable than the prospect of the reward itself, especially when the prey is cunning or shows evasive abilities.~
@2768 = ~Do you mean, you could hunt a man or an elf for sport, rejoicing in his fear?~
@2769 = ~I may be a man with few scruples, but I do not indulge in sadistic behaviour. Such manners will only lessen the noble art of the hunt.~
@2770 = ~So, what is your real motivation?~
@2771 = ~One has to earn a living. Such a thing is best achieved when using one's skills and expertise, and at times the wits one has been blessed with.~
@2772 = ~The quaintness of your motives in life resembles your whimsical childhood. Have you no other ambition in your chosen career but to earn a living?~
@2773 = ~Where have I erred to draw your indignation? And then I ask you, what is life's goal if not to survive or to fill the void of a vast emptiness?~
@2774 = ~I've asked for your real aspiration in life thrice now, but all your answers have been extremely disappointing.~
@2775 = ~If your questions were slightly less ambiguous, I believe I could give you a straight answer.~
@2776 = ~I thought a bounty hunter would enjoy a chase in a maze. Obviously not.~
@2777 = ~Leave me be, Sheena. I tire of your idiosyncrasies.~
	
@8000 = ~Those *eyeballs* are huge!~
@8001 = ~I suddenly question the reach of my arm.~
@8002 = ~These shadows will feed on our strength and leave us weakened. At times, I regret not becoming a cleric and not being able to turn those undead immediately.~
@8003 = ~We all have to face difficult choices in life. It is how we make them that really matters.~
@8004 = ~At times, we are faced with difficult choices. It is how we make them that really matters.~
@8005 = ~Stop wasting time, just throw a fireball down their gullets.~
@8006 = ~That's why Anomen travels with us.~
@8007 = ~That's why Aerie travels with us.~
@8008 = ~That's why Viconia travels with us.~
@8009 = ~I have no compunctions about my past choices, but was merely pointing out how easy it is for a cleric.~
@8010 = ~I have no compunctions about my past choices, but was merely pointing out how easy it is for you.~
@8011 = ~A mace of disruption would do a neater job, but if you say so.~
@8012 = ~Well, tell Anomen to do what clerics do; these shadows are breathing down my neck.~
@8013 = ~Well, tell Aerie to do what clerics do; these shadows are breathing down my neck.~
@8014 = ~Well, tell Viconia to do what clerics do; these shadows are breathing down my neck.~
@8015 = ~Those servants of Sseth, the serpent god, are cunning and devious.~
@8016 = ~How can you possibly know so much about every monster that exists?~
@8017 = ~You're not having second thoughts about killing a distant cousin, are you?~
@8018 = ~My stepfather owns a copy of Elminster's book called Monster's Ecologies volume I.~
@8019 = ~A small reward for repairing the Archmage's robe when he travelled to the spine of the world.~
@8020 = ~I do not have any, but could you *please* stop making despicable allusions to my lineage.~
@8021 = ~That's one BIG golem. I fear my sword will be of no better use than a toothpick against that one.~
@8022 = ~Avoid its fists and keep hitting until it falls.~
@8023 = ~Do you think it is really the time to discuss our tactic here? Hell no! Just hit the damn thing!~
@8024 = ~It is more easily said than done. There's not even a scratch on his armour yet.~
@8025 = ~I'd like you to come forward this once, and not just cast your spells safely from the rear.~
@8026 = ~It hurts a lot more when you are the person taking all the damn painful blows.~
@8027 = ~Yes! I'll wait for you now. Try to backstab that one if you can.~
@8028 = ~I hope you keep your healing spells ready. I fear I'm going to need them soon.~
@8029 = ~As long as you match my blows, I am glad to fight at your side, <CHARNAME>.~
@8030 = ~The immortal lich is a deadly foe and his wrath if disturbed is legendary.~
@8031 = ~It would have been much wiser if we had not disturbed his resting place.~
@8032 = ~Great! How was I supposed to know a lich lay down here?~
@8033 = ~If you want to act like a coward, just find yourself a place to hide. I am not backing out because one of my companions has had second thoughts about tackling a lich.~
@8034 = ~I think I'm scared too, Sheena. Will you hold my hand?~
@8035 = ~Anger won't help, <CHARNAME>. We'd better cool our heads and start thinking how we are going to deal with that undead.~
@8036 = ~Your words are insulting, <CHARNAME>. I am not a coward.~
@8037 = ~Your hands are far more useful when they open your spellbook.~
@8038 = ~Your hands are far more useful when praying for the power to turn undead, <CHARNAME>.~
@8039 = ~Your hands are far more useful when they lay devious traps.~
@8040 = ~Your hands are far more useful when they reach for your weapon.~
@8041 = ~The hideous gaze of the Umber Hulks is a deadly weapon. We must overrun them quickly, before too much confusion arises from the battle.~
@8042 = ~Try to avoid their tentacles at all costs, lest you want them to feast on your brain, <CHARNAME>.~
@8043 = ~It is my first time in a big city. I would have never imagined it could be so BIG.~
@8044 = ~Maybe travelling at my side is worth it after all?~
@8045 = ~I made the same comment when I first arrived at Baldur's gate.~
@8046 = ~I would certainly be far more comfortable living in my home than living the life of an adventurer, but I have to admit; travelling with you is far from dull, <CHARNAME>.~
@8047 = ~One can only marvel and wonder at such a grand sight. But I have always wondered why so many people chose to live together?~
@8048 = ~People often prefer the amenities offered by large cities to the boring life of a small village.~
@8049 = ~It is usually much safer to hide behind the high walls of a large city than to live in a small village.~
@8050 = ~I hope we shall be fortunate enough to see all the wonders this city has to offer.~
@8051 = ~Cities also attract all kinds of thugs, lurking in dark alleys at night, ready to rob the late stroller of his purse or his life.~
@8052 = ~This motive is obviously questionable.~
@8053 = ~This is not the nicest place to settle in. It seems there is nothing here but drunken sailors and throat cutting pirates.~
@8054 = ~We have to be careful, I agree.~
@8055 = ~We had best watch our backs, lest we find a blade sticking out of them.~
@8056 = ~I agree - I bet you ten gold coins someone holds a blade out there with our names written on it.~
@8057 = ~You bet! I would truly be a fool if I took you up on that one.~
@8058 = ~Maybe, but ten gold coins is not an amount to be wasted on a foolish bet.~
@8059 = ~I'll take you up on that one. I guess we'll find out soon enough if someone is expecting us.~
@8060 = ~And I won't bet the other way round, either.~
@8061 = ~What about I'll buy you a drink if I'm wrong? It seems a popular form of entertainment 'round here.~
@8062 = ~Aye. I'm all for it.~
@8063 = ~It is best if we stay sober.~
@8064 = ~If you lose and we survive, I'll be glad to buy you a drink and even throw in a good meal.~
@8065 = ~I could live here if only it wasn't inhabited by all kind of monstrous creatures, drow in particular.~
@8066 = ~I've always found the shadows in dark places quite comforting.~
@8067 = ~Maybe a longing from your draconic origins?~
@8068 = ~Wouldn't you miss the sun, the trees, and all the other delights of the surface?~
@8069 = ~I've never dwelt in caves and would surely loathe the solitary life most dragons endure.~
@8070 = ~I simply feel more at ease in dark places when I expose my draconic form.~
@8071 = ~I believe we just opened the gate to hell.~
@8072 = ~Many demons dwell in this dark place, I sense.~
@8073 = ~Good! It means we are a step closer to the demon heart which Lavok requested.~
@8074 = ~How would you know such things, Sheena?~
@8075 = ~Or a step closer to our deaths. Demons are creatures to be feared and not to be engaged in combat lightly.~
@8076 = ~My dragon sense warned me of their presence as they must be now aware of mine.~
@8077 = ~I should not have come to this place with you.~
@8078 = ~What are you blathering about Sheena?~
@8079 = ~I see nothing wrong with this place, Sheena. What is troubling you?~
@8080 = ~Did my real father not plot the death of their brethren? My presence here will land you in trouble if they discover my true identity.~
@8081 = ~You bear as much blame in their deaths as I do.~
@8082 = ~Stay well out of sight, and please, don't utter a word.~
@8083 = ~Aye, sensible advice.~
@8084 = ~Why are you dragging me here, <CHARNAME>?~
@8085 = ~I do not wish to see the mortal remains of an evil monster.~
@8086 = ~I don't want to carry the skin of that monster. Take it back <CHARNAME>.~
@8087 = ~I don't want to carry the armour made of that monster. Take it back <CHARNAME>.~
@8088 = ~You don't seem to be indifferent to the exotic nature of the drow, <CHARNAME>.~
@8089 = ~Whom I bed is none of your business, Sheena.~
@8090 = ~It may be hard to believe, but I only performed my duty.~
@8091 = ~Believe it or not, it was a painful experience.~
@8092 = ~Mixing duty and pleasure will often lead to disaster.~
@8093 = ~We should all be glad she is still mistaking you for a drow.~
@8094 = ~That satisfied smile on your face as you came out from her bedchamber did tell another story. But who am I to question your taste?~
@8095 = ~Exactly!~
@8096 = ~Did I sense some jealousy in your words?~
@8097 = ~If this is a proposal to share my bedroll tonight, sort of trying the half dragon after the drow, then you were awfully mistaken, <CHARNAME>.~
@8098 = ~I'm sorry you felt it this way. It was not my intent.~
@8099 = ~You and I? Can't I convince you somehow to try it at least once?~
@8100 = ~Oh, go away <CHARNAME>, and before I really get mad with you.~
@8101 = ~How could you!? Were you so covetous of the drow's body that you dared to ignore my own feelings?~
@8102 = ~Believe me or not, it was a painful experience, but necessary.~
@8103 = ~Is that so? Well perhaps, a pleasure slave would be more suited to your depraved morality.~
@8104 = ~I'm done with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@8105 = ~Is this the just reward I truly deserve after giving my heart to you? I was so naive in believing in a relationship with you. ~
@8106 = ~You falter at the first hurdle placed on your path. How pathetic!~
@8107 = ~And do not expect your treachery to remain unpunished, <CHARNAME>.~
@8108 = ~A convenient but poor excuse that doesn't justify what happened in Phaere's bedroom last night.~
@8109 = ~Our lives are holding by a thread in this city. Displeasing Phaere could have threatened our mission, and my ultimate goal to recover my soul.~
@8110 = ~I have no compunction about what I've done. It was for the best of all of us.~
@8111 = ~Then I forgive you <CHARNAME>, and only this once. Stray from this relationship only once more, and you will truly regret it.~
@8112 = ~We are so alike now, child of Bhaal. The beast within you is the essence, the legacy of your immortal father, whilst mine is one of an ancient race.~
@8113 = ~As you clearly pointed it out, my immortal essence is quite different from yours.~
@8114 = ~You've made me curious, Sheena; how do you control the beast within?~
@8115 = ~Does it not fight against you for control? Is it not trying to sway your heart into the forces of darkness and evil?~
@8116 = ~Yes, it does at times. But I remain in control.~
@8117 = ~I can feel its power nurturing my soul. We shall accomplish great deeds together.~
@8118 = ~I feel it struggling sometimes, and it drains most of my strength when I try to keep the beast at bay. It feasts on your most heartfelt emotions such as anger, deception, anguish and sorrow. Those are the times you have to be more careful.~
@8119 = ~But as you clearly pointed it out, it is an immortal essence, so my struggles are very different.~
@8120 = ~What else can you tell me about it?~
@8121 = ~The beast is not its appearance, but the essence that will try to take over your soul. It will be most dangerous when unleashed, for it is the time when the struggle for power will start.~
@8122 = ~You'd kill all of the good in this world just to satisfy your monstrous ego. I despise you.~
@8123 = ~I'm siding with Adalon. Let us see, *coward,* how well you fight.~
@8124 = ~What a horrible sight and... smell! I think I'm about to throw up.~
@8125 = ~Urghhh... ~
@8126 = ~Are you all right, Sheena?~
@8127 = ~Give me a few moments, <CHARNAME>. I need to get used to this stench.~
@8128 = ~You frighten me, fortune teller. I wonder why I wanted to know all this. I'd better leave you now.~
@8129 = ~What can I expect from a doomed fate?~

@8142 = ~(Her lips taste like sweet honey and you soon find yourselves in a passionate embrace.)~
@8143 = ~(Sheena quickly pulls away.) No, this is wrong. We mustn't-~
@8144 = ~There is nothing wrong with a kiss, Sheena. Besides, you seemed to enjoy it.~
@8145 = ~You are right. Forgive me my bold manners.~
@8146 = ~(Sheena delicately places the palm of her hand on your lips.) This is wrong <CHARNAME>. We mustn't.~
@8147 = ~There is nothing wrong with a sweet kiss Sheena.~
@8148 = ~You are right. Forgive me my daring manners.~
@8149 = ~(Take her hand in yours and kiss Sheena's hand.)~
@8150 = ~(Sheena's head shies away, her rosy cheeks reddened by your boldness.)~
@8151 = ~(She finally recovers and dares to speak.) Sorry <CHARNAME>, but this is surely wrong.~
@8152 = ~(Sheena's lips remain tightly sealed as you press your lips against hers.)~
@8153 = ~You are kind <CHARNAME>, but I cannot allow myself to be so intimate with you.~
@8154 = ~I have vowed to remain celibate, save I find one akin to me.~

@8158 = ~The lengthy book provides numerous examples of marriages between humans and dragons and other creatures which have turned into a nightmare such as:~
@8159 = ~Ten ways to survive your dragon companion's bad cough: roll flat at the first signs of sneezing, how to pile up your potions of fire resistance, and where to take your vacation away from the lair.~
@8160 = ~1000 recipes for your gourmet monster companion, thus avoiding setting yourself on the menu.~
@8161 = ~Feel itchy? Your back needs to be scratched? Teach your dragon companion in one hour how to put his claws to good use.~
@8162 = ~Your dragon companion skips the preliminaries in the bedchamber, and you no longer have fun. Have you tried to slide down his back and tail?~
@8163 = ~I am not a pet <CHARNAME>. So, get your hand off me!~
@8164 = ~(The light and slender membrane feels soft to the touch, but Sheena quickly folds her wings behind her back.)~
@8165 = ~(Sheena's wings flutter swiftly, signalling that the touch of your hand is unwelcome.)~
@8166 = ~(You feel the soft membrane shiver under your light stroke, and Sheena is clearly blushing.)~
@8167 = ~You seem fascinated by my wings or else why do you touch them?~
@8168 = ~I merely wanted to see how they felt to the touch.~
@8169 = ~It must be very uncomfortable carrying such large and heavy appendices.~
@8170 = ~This is a poor excuse for stroking me like a pet.~
@8171 = ~I have a lifetime to get used to them.~
@8172 = ~(Sheena's tail swiftly swerves under your feet. Although you are clearly taken off balance, you surprisingly manage to keep on your feet.)~
@8173 = ~Your manners befit a six year old and not a man of your age. Stop acting like a child, <CHARNAME>.~
@8174 = ~I am not amused by your childish behaviour and clearly won't put up with it much longer.~
@8175 = ~Try it again and I'll kick your butt with it.~
@8176 = ~At the age of six, my stepfather gave me a pseudo-dragon companion for my birthday. I named him Skaltifex.~
@8177 = ~He was dear to me and each evening we used to take a stroll in the mountains. I had little friends among humans and Skaltifex's unconditional love and affection proved to be a good surrogate to friendship.~
@8178 = ~Unfortunately, he developed an incurable lung disease and died before I turned eight. I felt so sad.~
@8179 = ~My stepfather offered to procure another one, but I was so stricken with grief that I refused; I've never owned a pet since.~
@8180 = ~I can give you my familiar if you want him.~
@8181 = ~Your stepfather surely gave you the most incongruous gift I ever heard of.~
@8182 = ~I wonder if a pet can really prove himself a surrogate to a real friend.~
@8183 = ~A kind and generous offer <CHARNAME>, which I'll be prompt to decline. I promised myself never to own a pet again.~
@8184 = ~There was no ill-intent in my stepfather's choice of gift. I loved Skaltifex the moment I saw him.~
@8185 = ~Maybe not, but then, that tiny dragon wasn't scared, each time I appeared in my half dragon form before him.~
@8186 = ~My best friend was a half elf, found abandoned in the woods and taken in by a woodcutter and his wife.~
@8187 = ~Her stepfather dropped her to our home one day, because his wife was sick and he could not watch over her whilst in the woods. These are the circumstances in which I met Lilandra for the first time.~
@8188 = ~She was a year younger than I, curious and full of life, but she had a mischievous glare in her eyes. My first impression would prove me right.~
@8189 = ~After only ten minutes, she had broken the wooden sword my stepfather had carved, and torn apart the woollen doll my mother had expertly crafted during the last winter.~
@8190 = ~I was so angered at this child that I decided to show her my half dragon form.~
@8191 = ~Lilandra certainly looked at me with an air of bewilderment, but when I expected her to flee she simply stood there, and then, sat down.~
@8192 = ~I dared not to speak, still hoping she would leave, but then she started asking me questions about my half dragon form.~
@8193 = ~In the end, we became good friends and saw each other regularly.~
@8194 = ~Do you still have news of your friend?~
@8195 = ~Ah! So, you do have good friends among the common races.~
@8196 = ~The last letter I received from her was an invitation to her wedding. She was going to wed some rich merchant trading in Targos. Unfortunately adue to Lord Jierdan's plans, I clearly missed it.~
@8197 = ~I hope she believes me when I tell her about my real origins, and won't hold too much grudge.~
@8198 = ~Occasionally, and if they can withstand a half dragon for a friend.~
@8199 = ~Our home is like an eagle's nest, perched high up in the mountains. Our wooden balcony where the whole family used to sit in the evening offers a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains and the valley below.~
@8200 = ~It is a beauty hard to describe with mere words, and I truly wish you could see it with your own eyes.~
@8201 = ~Because of my stepfather's smouldering forge or perhaps being a half dragon, the folks nicknamed our home the red dragon lair.~
@8202 = ~My stepfather keeps a shop in the village below, so that strangers coming to commission a blade or an armour do not have to face the long walk up or a misfortunate encounter face-to-chest with a half red dragon.~
@8203 = ~He certainly was always wary of strangers passing through our village. Perhaps he was afraid Lord Jierdan would one day find out about me.~
@8204 = ~He must be as we speak.~
@8205 = ~I wouldn't worry too much. If your stepfather comes to Athkatla, Ribald is likely to tell him that he has seen you and you are well.~
@8206 = ~We could try and send a messenger to your father.~
@8207 = ~Damn! Why did I not give a letter to Ribald to be sent with his messenger?~
@8208 = ~I wonder who would travel to see my father. My best bet would be a merchant in Amn, but it would be surely like finding the proverbial needle in a haystack.~
@8209 = ~My mother died when I was nineteen. By that time, I was fully aware my stepfather was not my real father.~
@8210 = ~On her deathbed, I asked her the name of my real father, but she simply started weeping, faintly whispering the words: forgive me, Sheena.~
@8211 = ~How can someone not forgive her mother? But at that very moment, I thought her secret would die with her and never replied.~
@8212 = ~I still feel guilty about my own selfishness on that day.~
@8213 = ~I wonder if your mother ever found out Lord Jierdan was a dragon in disguise.~
@8214 = ~Do you think your mother left your stepfather in the dark all these years?~
@8215 = ~How did your stepfather meet your mother and you?~
@8216 = ~She must have realized it the day I was born.~
@8217 = ~I imagine my mother too ashamed to really tell the truth to anyone, including those who were most kind to her.~
@8218 = ~After my birth, my mother sought to kill us both, by trying to throw herself from the highest mountain peak. My stepfather happened to be there that day, and stopped my mother's suicidal attempt.~
@8219 = ~The rest of the story would fill an entire book.~
@8220 = ~My hair feels as real as yours, doesn't it? Yet, it is nothing but a powerful illusion born in your mind, <CHARNAME>.~
@8221 = ~(The glistening of Sheena's auburn hair fades under the shadow of your hand. She is aware of your hand but remains still.)~
@8222 = ~(Your finger mingles with one of Sheena's locks. She gently takes your hand away, disentangling your finger from her lock.)~
@8223 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, you should comb your unkempt hair first, and leave mine alone.~
@8224 = ~I've spent hours on my hair this morning, but you managed to ruin it in an instant.~
@8225 = ~(Sheena's hand feels cold to the touch, and her greasy reptilian scales send shivers down your spine. You quickly pull your hand away. Sheena barely notices your small hand is gone.)~
@8226 = ~(Her hand is so big that you are reminded of your childhood, holding the hand of a grown up. And the size of the nails on her claws - you realize - are those of your little finger.)~
@8227 = ~(You walk hand in hand with uneasiness for a while, until your hand breaks free.)~
@8228 = ~(Sheena tightly squeezes her grip on your hand, showing you her strength and signalling an unwanted move.)~
@8229 = ~Sheena! Stop!~
@8230 = ~(Look at Sheena defiantly.)~
@8231 = ~(When she releases her grip, you quickly take your sore hand away.)~
@8232 = ~I'm sorry <CHARNAME>, sometimes I can't feel my own strength.~
@8233 = ~(The pain in your hand is growing, and Sheena squeezes even harder.)~
@8234 = ~(Keep looking at Sheena defiantly.)~
@8235 = ~(Sheena abruptly releases her grip and let go your hand.)~
@8236 = ~Your little game nearly cost you a broken hand.~
@8237 = ~Ask yourself: will pride really be of use to your cause?~
@8238 = ~(Sheena's hand quickly pulls away, grabbing firmly the hilt of her sword.)~
@8239 = ~(With ease, Sheena intertwines her fingers with yours. She throws a quick glance in your direction, checking your expression, which prompts her to smile.)~
@8240 = ~Tell me my friend, do you always feel compelled to hold the hand of your female companions?~
@8241 = ~You are the first one, I swear!~
@8242 = ~Always, and especially when I'm in a joyous mood.~
@8243 = ~Friend? I was hoping you'd be inclined to a bit more than friendship.~
@8244 = ~(laugh) You are *very* good. You don't even blush to such a blatant lie!~
@8245 = ~Well, keep holding my hand or else I might become jealous of every woman we meet.~
@8246 = ~Your hopes have been misplaced <CHARNAME>, and I won't let them linger any longer. (Sheena frees her hand from your grip.)~
@8247 = ~(Sheena takes your hand but does not allow your fingers to mingle. You walk side by side, her stare clearly fixed on the road ahead.)~
@8248 = ~So, where are you leading me, my fearless leader?~
@8249 = ~I don't know. If you turn left now, I'll probably follow you.~
@8250 = ~Nowhere. Let us enjoy and treasure this moment of peace.~
@8251 = ~On the path of pleasurable moments, my dear Sheena.~
@8252 = ~With such whimsical guidance, we'll probably end with both of our feet wet.~
@8253 = ~I couldn't agree less. It's been such a long time since I last enjoyed a peaceful moment.~
@8254 = ~Then I'll just close my eyes, think of my home and let you be my guide.~
@8255 = ~(Sheena takes your hand but surprisingly places it around her shoulder while wrapping her arm around yours.)~
@8256 = ~It looks more manly this way, don't you think?~
@8257 = ~If I had wanted this to look more manly, I would have chosen a man instead.~
@8258 = ~Whatever pleases you, Sheena.~
@8259 = ~It would feel more intimate if you leaned your head on my shoulder, against my neck and cheek.~
@8260 = ~Some say I look manlier than most girls. Maybe my body's muscular, but what do you think?~
@8261 = ~As long as you don't grow a beard like most dwarven women, you'll still look feminine.~
@8262 = ~Your human appearance looks athletic but not overly manly.~
@8263 = ~Your chest does not hide your feminine nature.~
@8264 = ~(smile) If that happens, I think I should shave it.~
@8265 = ~I guess the life on the road keeps us fit and in shape. And since I feel compelled to answer your flattery with a compliment: well, you don't look too bad yourself, for a <PRO_RACE>.~
@8266 = ~Well, keep your gaze above my chest, will you? This uncouth remark is clearly unwelcome.~
@8267 = ~(Sheena leans her head on your shoulder and you walk side by side for a long time.)~
@8268 = ~(Sheena's hand quickly pulls out, firmly grabbing the hilt of her sword, clearly embarrassed by such an intimate attempt.)~

@8269 = ~I was having a late afternoon stroll in the mountains when an early night caught me, and left me unable to find my way back home.~
@8270 = ~The sky was darkened by a rising storm. I needed to find shelter quickly before the freezing winds of that imminent blizzard killed me.~
@8271 = ~Luckily, I found a cavern but its entrance was kept by an enormous and irritated grizzly bear.~
@8272 = ~I quickly turned into a half dragon to scare the beast away, but it only made him angrier and he raised himself on his back legs, groaning furiously with anger.~
@8273 = ~Although that cavern meant warmth and shelter, my mind struggled against killing this bear. I was intruding upon his home and he was simply defending himself.~
@8274 = ~His life or mine. The choice seems obvious to me, but then, what would *you* do?~
@8275 = ~The grizzly's pelt would have kept you warm and given you a good nights sleep.~
@8276 = ~You have noble feelings towards other creatures, but they could cost you dearly.~
@8277 = ~I used a charm spell on the bear and luckily it worked. I then tied him up and brought him safely inside the cave.~
@8278 = ~To my amazement, it was a - she - bear and she had several new born cubs.~
@8279 = ~I still feel relieved I did not kill her, for the cubs would not have survived long without their mother.~

@8280 = ~(Sheena places her hands around your neck and gently pulls you towards her, lowering her eyelids, her luscious lips opening slightly.)~
@8281 = ~(Your tongues mingle in a frenetic and feverish sword fight.)~
@8282 = ~(The moment seems to last a lifetime, but as always, such exquisite moments vanish too quickly.)~
@8283 = ~(Sheena takes your hand and you walk side by side, wordlessly, for a long time.)~
@8284 = ~(You press your questing lips firmly onto her soft and luscious ones, requesting entrance to her mouth.)~
@8285 = ~(Sheena pulls you closer, inviting you to deepen the exquisite kiss, stroking your back as your tongues entwine.)~
@8286 = ~(Your embrace lasts until interrupted by the coughing of a nearby and obviously shocked bystander.)~
@8287 = ~(Both of you still hug each other, oblivious to the world around, certain your love for one another is growing stronger.)~
@8288 = ~(You trail your lips up her neckline, kissing her soft flesh, until you finally reach her ear. A gentle nibble of her lobe sends a shiver through her body.)~
@8289 = ~(Sheena turns to face you, embracing you with welcoming arms, her parted lips inviting you to a more intimate kiss.)~
@8290 = ~(Your kiss is so passionate and intense that both of you fail to notice all those puzzled eyes around, transfixed on the two of you.)~
@8291 = ~(At the end of your embrace, you are made aware of those eyes watching you, but their glances quickly shy away.)~
@8292 = ~(Sheena seizes you, seeking another long and passionate kiss.)~
@8293 = ~(She finally releases her grip, gasping for air, her gaze fixed on your eyes. A long time elapses, before she finally dares to break this moment with a few whispered words.)~
@8294 = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@8295 = ~(Sheena welcomes your embrace with open arms, holding you tightly as if she were afraid of losing you.)~
@8296 = ~I wish we stayed like this forever, <CHARNAME>.~
@8297 = ~We'll find the time soon enough for more pleasurable moments.~
@8298 = ~(Release your grip.)~
@8299 = ~The endless time spent on the road makes me wonder if such blissful moments will ever come again.~
@8300 = ~Why are you letting go of me so quickly?~
@8301 = ~(Take Sheena back in your arms.)~
@8302 = ~I tire of you, Sheena.~
@8303 = ~You have a peculiar way of declaring your unswerving love. Maybe some time without talking to one another will do us much good.~
@8304 = ~It is freezing today. Please, hold me in your arms, <CHARNAME>.~
@8305 = ~(Sheena kisses you full on the lips and you feel the softness of her mouth, then the flicker of her tongue against your teeth. Her arms around your body are warm and strong as she pulls you towards her, her body tightly pressing against yours.)~
@8306 = ~(Sheena closes her eyes, abandoning herself to your strength and the warmth from your mouth suffusing her whole body.)~
@8307 = ~(You move behind Sheena, your cheek against hers, wrapping her in your arms. In your protective embrace, you sway from side to side.)~
@8308 = ~(whisper) My time with you is a blessed one.~
@8309 = ~Such a delicate face, lovely features and flaming eyes alight my heart. My body burns with the desire to hold you tonight in a fiery embrace until the ashes of dawn.~
@8310 = ~Alas, I am a half red dragon in disguise, and your body would melt into a heap of ashes the moment my blazing lips meet yours.~
@8311 = ~What a pity. Oh well,... patron! Another ale please.~
@8312 = ~Bregg! Wait! I can't swim.~
@8313 = ~Ye fool, the - she - dragon will roast ye alive. If ye had some wits, ye'd dash to the docks and jump into the water.~
@8314 = ~On this day, you've hit the wrong stooge and infuriated a red dragon. Out of my sight, miserable worms!~
@8315 = ~Now ye've done it, ye blasted fool! Ye've unleashed a red dragon in the city! I'm gettin' out of here before the - she - dragon sets me ablaze.~
@8316 = ~Wait! Where are you going, you blasted dwarf?~
@8317 = ~Before you perish evil wyrm, this half dragon has a question for you.~
@8318 = ~How amusing that you - a puny dragon - would dare to face me. Maybe I'll spare you if you step aside and let me finish the fleshlings first.~
@8319 = ~I won't simply step aside and watch you hurt my friends.~
@8320 = ~Then die too, dragonling.~
@8321 = ~Irenicus is selfish, corrupt and worse, a traitor to his own kind. He is likely to betray his promise at the first opportunity.~
@8322 = ~Irenicus shall honour his word to Nizidramanii'yt or be served for dinner. Moreover, I am not swayed by your appearance, half wyrm.~
@8323 = ~If Irenicus dies, your dreams of fortune will vanish like a cloud of black smoke blown by the wind. That goblet is worthless to you, is it not?~
@8324 = ~Have you nothing else to offer but sweet words? Even if my dream vanishes, I will still have eaten lunch.~
@8325 = ~A half red dragon in my lair! You are far from being welcome here. Speak quickly, what is it you seek?~
@8326 = ~I have come to find some answers about my draconic heritage, my Lady, and I hope for truth. Have you ever heard of a red dragon named Firkraag?~
@8327 = ~Speak not his name in my abode. Long ago, his pathetic attempt to seduce me in an alleged peace between the hoards ended up in a memorable fight. We both still bear painful scars on our scales.~
@8328 = ~Firkraag said he was my father. Could it be true?~
@8329 = ~Red dragons tend to be secretive and rarely share their devious plans with outsiders, unless it serves a purpose.~
@8330 = ~I've never had the chance to talk of my draconic heritage, what will be my fate?~
@8331 = ~I cannot say outright. Your wings are well formed, and so you could one day grow into a red dragon; that is, if you survive long enough. But you bore me, child, let me talk to your travelling companion, the one they call <CHARNAME>.~
@8332 = ~My disguise serves us well in this part of the city. The town folks are surely edgy with all those atrocities committed. They would stone to death any monster they'd see, and surely much faster than a drunkard can drink his first ale.~
@8333 = ~Legend is in the making, <CHARNAME>. I hope elven historians will write our names someday in honour of our deeds. After striking a bitter blow at the heart of their enemy, we are now heading to rescue their city.~
@8334 = ~Time to get our feet wet in the sewers and expose this filthy cult!~
@8335 = ~Then meet our blades and your final demise, miscreant of the dark god!~
@8336 = ~Forgive my friend, my lady. A temporary bout of madness is certainly to blame. Let me release you from your bonds. You are unharmed, I hope?~
@8337 = ~You are mistaken, my Lady. I am no knight but can nonetheless adopt their chivalry.~
@8338 = ~Thank you, Ma'am. Nobody's ever been so kind to me.~
@8339 = ~Yes, I do. Here's a coin to tie you up. Go and drink some ale before your tongue dries up from all this nonsensical blathering.~
@8340 = ~I don't think that ogre is much of a threat, <CHARNAME>. Besides, I sympathize with his story and wouldn't want to hurt him. I know the prejudice of which he speaks all too well.~
@8341 = ~Wow! Five centuries! We're likely to find many skeletons and dusty bones here. Or do you think someone could live that long, <CHARNAME>?~
@8342 = ~History and justice finally caught up with him. I surmise there won't be many family members attending his funeral.~
@8343 = ~History and justice finally caught up with him. Valygar, I hope you will give your relative a proper burial since he admitted to his past sins.~
@8344 = ~His final resting place belongs here, inside the sphere. He deserves no better after the terrible scourge he heaped onto his family.~
@8345 = ~The foul murderer should not be allowed to escape his ultimate fate, this time.~
@8346 = ~A charitable thief who also remained true to his words. He almost redeemed their profession with his deed.~
@8347 = ~She's far too young and frail to join us in our perilous adventures, <CHARNAME>. Hmmm... and certainly don't expect of me to do any baby-sitting nor indulge in dragon story telling.~
@8348 = ~A pretty high price to keep their prying eyes shut, yet it proves once again that in the city of coin everything has its price, including the notorious cowled wizards.~
@8349 = ~A red dragon! The city is under attack! Prepare to fight for your lives!~
@8350 = ~I'm afraid her mother might have lost her purposely.~
@8351 = ~I felt quite sea sick the other day, but the prospect of entering the Underdark is even less comforting.~
@8352 = ~Now don't be hasty, Mazzy. I could scare off the brute and make him swallow his pride, if you let me.~
@8353 = ~Do not interfere ,Sheena! The honour and pride of the Halfling race is at stake.~
@8354 = ~Very clever of you, <CHARNAME>. A bit mean toward that poor girl though. I dare not imagine her fate once this Gorf finds out, but then, Mazzy's life is paramount to our mission.~
@8355 = ~Your orders are my commands. I shall do as you as you say, Oh Great One.~
@8356 = ~Red dragons do not bow before human gods, you impudent lout! Bow, I say! Bow before Tiamat, Queen and Goddess of dragons and beg for her mercy.~
@8357 = ~B-But... but how in Cyric's name is this possible?~
@8358 = ~Stop this annoying stuttering and answer me!~
@8359 = ~Yes, my Lady. I bow before your majestic sight. I shall convert my faith, Oh Mighty Lady Dragon, and follow you as a faithful worshipper of the one and only true Dragon faith.~
@8360 = ~You are not worthy of following me, you miserable worm.~
@8361 = ~But my Lady, I vow my life... ~
@8362 = ~(Sigh. Why did I start all this?) Enough! If you wish to serve, you are to start a church. Gather as many followers as you can, and I will visit you soon to reveal the ten commandments of the Dragon Goddess.~
@8363 = ~I have some noble blood too. Whilst my lineage may not be very commendable, gratitude is nonetheless what I had expected in the first place.~
@8364 = ~I recall that village. I must have passed through it when Conster brought me to the Windspear hills. Nights were particularly creepy out there, and even Conster looked worried.~
@8365 = ~Nothing to fear, I'll roast them alive, then set ablaze their miserable carcasses.~
@8366 = ~I wish Renal had sent us to put an end to the sadist and not to enlist in his service.~
@8367 = ~Thievery, larceny and now plain murder. The list of horrors we have to perform for this monster seems to be endless. I tire of it, <CHARNAME>.~
@8368 = ~Treachery and deceit portray well my opinion of thieves. I never thought I would join their ranks one day.~
@8369 = ~I wish you had been given another pet to play with. That tiny dragon is a bitter reminder of who I am.~
@8370 = ~I fear that without our intervention that good man will let himself be beaten up. This is wrong! We shouldn't allow the injustice to happen.~
@8371 = ~Wait now... yer face looks familiar. Don't ye work in the streets?~
@8372 = ~No. I only arrived recently in this city.~
@8373 = ~Well, sorry. 't must have been yer twin sister then. What a night to remember!~
@8374 = ~Mmm... you there! You're a dragon in disguise, spying on us to prepare your attack on the city, aren't you?!~
@8375 = ~You are mistaken good Sir. I am a human.~
@8376 = ~Nay! I saw you dealing with those muggers the other day. I had a clear view of your face, and believe me, I'm not ready to forget you.~
@8377 = ~Well, what about ten coins to let my face slip out of your mind?~
@8378 = ~That will do. Don't think you're too much a threat anyway.~
@8379 = ~Gee Maam, you're so pretty. When I grow up, I'll ask you to marry me!~
@8380 = ~(laugh) You will find me old and wrinkled or have perished the thought long before.~
@8381 = ~I feel that creature is both mysterious and powerful, but a great evil too. She is likely to lure us into some devious plan.~
@8382 = ~Oh my! Who am I to fight a red dragon? Alright, if you want them out so bad, I'll let them out. I'd better head straight for the docks and get out myself though. Irenicus is going to be incensed.~
@8383 = ~You should want to do just as <PRO_HESHE> says. A red dragon recently landed here and is intent on overthrowing the current tyrant.~
@8384 = ~Nay! I want to hang yer head on the wall in me house, a fine trophy for me young son.~
@8385 = ~Step aside dwarf, or feel the wrath of a red dragon.~
@8386 = ~Well, I be blessed. Seems luck finally be on me side today. I always wanted to wear the skin of a red dragon.~
@8387 = ~You'll dig yourself a grave faster than you can run. Back off I say! I will be lenient and *shall* let you go.~
@8388 = ~Hey lass, what can you see from such a towering height?~
@8389 = ~If you are telling me, good Sir, that sadly you are small, you manage to lower yourself even farther by hassling every women you meet.~
@8390 = ~Ever heard of having a man in every port, hey? Well, I'd gladly be yours in this one.~
@8391 = ~Go fish somewhere else, sailor-boy. I can barely stand the awful stench of fish inlayed in your skin.~
@8392 = ~You seem like a nice and sensible child, and if I wasn't adventuring I'd actually consider taking you to my stepfather. He'd so much love to raise another child.~
@8393 = ~Their desires to emulate our ways might lead them on the wrong path.~
@8394 = ~We should discourage these young lads.~
@8395 = ~And now they want to indulge in a drinking bout. Typical young lads - I guess.~
@8396 = ~You won't get a coin for that advice. Though, I'll mind my steps, but *you* should be more vigilant in your choice of words.~
@8397 = ~What! A red dragon in Amn! Run for your lives! A dragon is attacking the city!!~
@8398 = ~Hey you! Back off or feel the wrath of a red dragon!~
@8399 = ~I have a fair idea of their fate. They've likely grown sharp teeth and a taste for blood. But who can blame them for trading eternal damnation for eternal life?~
@8400 = ~Well, if it isn't Samuel's outlandish stepdaughter. How does ye be, girlie?~
@8401 = ~Keeping up the spirits, Ribald. Did you get my stepfather's last consignment?~
@8402 = ~Aye, about a month ago. If ye see him, tell him I have a new commission. Cromwell's too busy.~
@8403 = ~There's a rich noble who's ready to part with a fair amount of gold in exchange of a warblade.~
@8404 = ~Sorry Ribald, you'll have to send the usual messenger. Adventure met me lately, and I'm now travelling with <CHARNAME>.~
@8405 = ~Damn! Yet another cost I'll have to swallow. Wish your father would come to live here.~
@8406 = ~Well, you know his love of the mountains and cold weather, so it won't happen anytime soon. The cold helps him endure the fire of his smouldering forge.~
@8407 = ~Heard that excuse too often. Well, have a look at me new venture then, and if ye see something ye fancy just let me know.~
@8408 = ~Samuel Thunderstorm sends his greeting, Cromwell.~
@8409 = ~Pah! The old cracker wouldn't be able to open a nutshell with his hammer, let alone craft a decent blade. Yer probably here asking me t' fix that cursed blade he sold you.~
@8410 = ~I'm his stepdaughter. You know that isn't true, Cromwell.~
@8411 = ~I remember ye. Ye had flappy wings and a big tail last time we met. Ye lost them fer better features. But yer right, be it not fer competition, I'd hav' to admit Samuel is a bloody good smithy. Beats steel faster than a sprinting dwarf.~
@8412 = ~Is there any way you could enhance my blade?~
@8413 = ~Plain to see. Twas made with his love for ye. Wouldn't touch it unless he gave me his blessing.~
@8414 = ~I understand. Do we have anything you could forge an item with?~
@8415 = ~It will be hard to keep an eye opened on their activities if we abide by their demand.~
@8416 = ~It is really sad to see people lose hope, faith, and the expectation of a better life. I truly pity them.~
@8417 = ~There must be a way to end their absurd condition, a way to restore their hopes.~
@8418 = ~We could ask my stepfather for Ilithium. He uses it at times for very special commissioned blades, and always keeps a few pounds at home.~
@8419 = ~Hmm... I doubt you intend to travel to the spine of the world for it.~
@8420 = ~Pay heed to my tale! A half dragon is on a quest for the most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart that demands from us we investigate some fallen paladins.~
@8421 = ~Hmm... I suddenly wonder what I got so excited about. They are likely to welcome us with thick metal armour and sharp swords.~
@8422 = ~A red half dragon amid the sanctity of our Order! You will die, beast!~
@8423 = ~A red half dragon amid the sanctity of our Order! You will die, beast!.~
@8424 = ~Stay your hand, Sir Trawl! That half dragon is under my protection.~
@8425 = ~Sir Keldorn! You have a strange choice of companions lately, but I have hardly any reason for questioning your motives.~
@8426 = ~I still follow the path of the vigilant one. That half dragon and I only follow the same path for the sake of <CHARNAME>.~
@8427 = ~Rest yourself, our intentions are noble.~
@8428 = ~The drow's intention to have a cleaner city is noble, but I also think that breeding an eight legged army would be more befitting her vile nature.~
@8429 = ~Once we rescue their actor, I hope we will see this play again. The current performance truly rates among the worst I've seen.~
@8430 = ~What a horrible tale! The villains behind this great malice should not be left unchecked, <CHARNAME>, lest we want to unearth more bodies tomorrow.~
@8431 = ~Don't be afraid, Risa. Kamir is a good man and will take care of you.~
@8432 = ~The child killer should be far more fearful of the living. I swear I'll pierce his black heart without hesitation when we find him.~
@8433 = ~Child murderer! Vile swine! You'd crawl on all fours to save your miserable skin but not this time.~
@8434 = ~The child's ghost and now a half dragon in my room! This is clearly insane. I'm tryin' hard to wake up now.~
@8435 = ~You're not dreamin' but my blade will put you into a very long sleep, very soon.~
@8436 = ~You can try to kill me, half dragon. What have I to lose?~
@8437 = ~With such a bad temper, looks and manners, I can clearly understand her husband's lust for other women.~
@8438 = ~Perhaps it would be best if we left that crypt undisturbed. That mantle is nothing but fuel for hatred.~
@8439 = ~We need to talk to that druid right away. He should be able to shed more light on this mystery.~
@8440 = ~Keep your hands off me, unless you want to feel my claws... (*cough*) nails scratching your back!~
@8441 = ~I'm afraid another corpse soon looms in our wake.~
@8442 = ~I usually prefer red meat, but I could certainly grow a taste for fish when hearing such despicable remarks.~
@8443 = ~Your eyes have been cheated, Ixilthetocal. I am a surface dweller with sharp claws and scales that match yours.~
@8444 = ~A half dragon in the midst of them! Strange, the shark-father's prophecy said nothing about it.~
@8445 = ~The dwarves' lust for the riches below was bound to land them in trouble.~
@8446 = ~We are gnomes, Svirfneblins, a proud race of the Underdark, who survived for generations the mighty Drow, the vicious Illithid, and the great orbs.~
@8447 = ~Yes. Small people are quite able to fend for themselves and my remark is certainly inappropriate, though this time, it seems you do *need* the help of the *big* people.~
@8448 = ~We meet again, and in dire circumstances; circumstances which could well provide us with an opportunity to settle our score in the Illithid pit.~
@8449 = ~Their ambush upon the sea amply demonstrated their skills, and we really need strong allies in such a foul place.~
@8450 = ~We have all the equipment and gold we need, it is not worth risking our lives.~
@8451 = ~Bah! Are a few more trinkets really worth endangering ourselves?~
@8452 = ~(whisper) I'm not sure how we could possibly stray from the path the matron mother has laid for us, but we need to think fast as it might collapse any moment beneath our feet.~
@8453 = ~I feel we are nothing more than cattle about to be sent to the slaughterhouse. This feeling is dreadful.~
@8454 = ~Only the most subservient males survive here. HE obviously is, or was.~
@8455 = ~I've been feeling the same as Solaufein ever since I set foot in this city, like some drow were following me, lurking behind my back, trying to slit my throat during my sleep.~
@8456 = ~This place really wears me down, <CHARNAME>... I hope this ordeal will soon come to an end.~
@8457 = ~We have more in common than I could have ever imagined. Within you lies a beast with enormous destructive power that no one has ever beheld.~
@8458 = ~If it is of little comfort, know that I suffer from my own accursed appearance and now... yours.~
@8459 = ~Leave me alone, Sheena. Your sympathy means nothing to me.~
@8460 = ~Your presence around me is unwelcome in present circumstances, I truly wish that *you* would leave me alone.~
@8461 = ~Thank you for your support, Sheena, though I doubt I need *your* help right now.~
@8462 = ~Yes, it so appears we share more than one path. Yet, it remains unclear if our paths crossing serves a purpose today.~
@8463 = ~I understand. I will not bore you with futile advices right now, except... talk to friends whenever you feel the need.~
@8464 = ~My role in this foul play is - I hope - one of goodness. Know that I will do my best to assist you on both paths, wherever they lead you.~
@8465 = ~Irenicus' experiments did not leave you unscathed. The loss of your soul might worsen your condition.~
@8466 = ~Exactly the words of comfort I needed to hear. Now, leave me be, Sheena.~
@8467 = ~As long as I have enough strength left, I will hang on to the hope of regaining my soul.~
@8468 = ~I'll never forgive myself for this blunder.~
@8469 = ~You might have lost your soul, but you have not lost your spirit. I am pleased to see you undimmed by recent events.~
@8470 = ~Sheena, an unswerving servant of justice, who despite the death of her real father at your hand, remained true and faithful to your cause.~
@8471 = ~Sheena... I - ~
@8472 = ~Sheena, this isn't your battle. You have a life with your stepfather. There is no need for you to continue.~
@8473 = ~Irenicus is a mage of immense power, Sheena. Our chances of survival are slim. You do not have to waste your life in a fight that isn't yours.~
@8474 = ~My steps will not falter when I walk that last staircase with you.~
@8475 = ~I owe you this much, my friend.~
@8476 = ~I would surely regret missing the end of this.~
@8477 = ~Besides, you need me to beat the odds.~
@8478 = ~Sheena: despite the death of her real father at your hand, she developed strong feelings for you and willingly bonded her fate to yours.~
@8479 = ~Sheena, this isn't your battle. You might still have a life with your stepfather.~
@8480 = ~Irenicus is a mage of immense power, Sheena. Our chances of survival are slim.~
@8481 = ~Our lives are tied. Whatever ill-fate lies ahead, I will share it you.~
@8482 = ~Cats have many lives, but I dearly hope that is Jon's last!~
@8483 = ~<CHARNAME>, those ignorant folks' racial prejudice and hatred is blatantly wrong. Are we simply going to sit here and watch a drow burn?~
@8484 = ~The shade lord has powerful allies. I am not a coward, but maybe just this once, we should come back another day with more allies, bigger swords and an array of powerful spells.~
@8485 = ~We'd better investigate the matter immediately, before that evil cult gathers more members.~
@8486 = ~That peddler sure knows how to sell his trinkets. He sounds like he invented the most dangerous missile since Melf concocted the Minute Meteors spell.~
@8487 = ~Such a powerful illusion can only be shaped by great evil.~
@8488 = ~Even the most powerful creature has weaknesses or a flaw in its armour. There must a way to defeat this *Faldorn*.~
@8489 = ~Traitor! You have forsaken the future of the silver dragon's children for your own selfish benefit. Consider yourself my sworn enemy.~
@8490 = ~Your half dragon heart wonders about its origin, but it is veiled in dark secrets. Do not linger in the past, everyone has a part to play in the grand design, even mysterious and hideous creatures.~
@8491 = ~One dark path was averted on the day your friend found you. But the thin rope you walk may snap before you reach the end. Not all hope is lost, child, have faith.~
@8492 = ~(whispering) We'd better not delay. It seems drows, among other 'virtues', have little patience, except for torture and other vile 'delicacies' bred deep inside their devious minds.~
@8493 = ~(loudly) We are to meet you at the entrance of the Illithid caverns and ambush some Illithid who have a Matron Mother's daughter captive.~
@8494 = ~The adviser may be foul and corrupt, but a frontal assault on the enemy could prove fatal. More allies, especially spellcasters, is advice worthy of your consideration.~
@8495 = ~The crows are standing at the door. I say we pluck their feathers and leave their bald carcasses to the vultures. This is all this 'Lord' Roenal really deserves.~
@8496 = ~I feel relieved she finally left. Her chills almost turned my blood to ice.~
@8497 = ~We must act swiftly and kill him. I have no desire to serve as his 'consort' and *you*, I presume, to serve as his new shell.~
@8498 = ~Although his way of life is likely to kill him soon enough, his assassination would have lessened us all.~
@8499 = ~Still, my lineage would pose too much of a threat. They are likely to slay me on sight and without trial.~
@8500 = ~Don't be afraid, Sheena. I will take you under my protection if I must.~
@8501 = ~Watch your slitted tongue, half lizard! If it intends to spit more venom at me, it will taste drow cruelty.~
@8502 = ~How dare you compare me with a monster? My features are undoubtedly more pleasing than yours.~
@8503 = ~Of all people, you should know better, Viconia. The drows's nature is devious, vindictive, and cruel. Most people rightly call them monsters. I find it even surprising you are offended by a cheap insult which must be tossed at you at every opportunity on the surface.~

@8600 = ~This is a cosy place, <CHARNAME>, when this is all over I may come back here and settle in.~
@8601 = ~I'm sure the current owner won't be able to object when we are finished here.~
@8602 = ~I knew you are different, Sheena, but this? This place sure needs some new decoration.~
@8603 = ~That said owner is still waiting while we talk.~
@8604 = ~I'm sure I can convince you of another place for the two of us. One that we both may find *cosy*.~
@8610 = ~We'll see about that.~
